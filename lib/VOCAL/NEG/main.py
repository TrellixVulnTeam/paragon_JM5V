      GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.


Although Mathematical Science is the most ancient and the most perfect
of all, yet the general idea which we ought to form of it has not yet
been clearly determined. Its definition and its principal divisions have
remained till now vague and uncertain. Indeed the plural name--"The
Mathematics"--by which we commonly designate it, would alone suffice to
indicate the want of unity in the common conception of it.

In truth, it was not till the commencement of the last century that the
different fundamental conceptions which constitute this great science
were each of them sufficiently developed to permit the true spirit of
the whole to manifest itself with clearness. Since that epoch the
attention of geometers has been too exclusively absorbed by the special
perfecting of the different branches, and by the application which they
have made of them to the most important laws of the universe, to allow
them to give due attention to the general system of the science.

But at the present time the progress of the special departments is no
longer so rapid as to forbid the contemplation of the whole. The science
of mathematics is now sufficiently developed, both in itself and as to
its most essential application, to have arrived at that state of
consistency in which we ought to strive to arrange its different parts
in a single system, in order to prepare for new advances. We may even
observe that the last important improvements of the science have
directly paved the way for this important philosophical operation, by
impressing on its principal parts a character of unity which did not
previously exist.

To form a just idea of the object of mathematical science, we may start
from the indefinite and meaningless definition of it usually given, in
calling it "_The science of magnitudes_," or, which is more definite,
"_The science which has for its object the measurement of magnitudes._"
Let us see how we can rise from this rough sketch (which is singularly
deficient in precision and depth, though, at bottom, just) to a
veritable definition, worthy of the importance, the extent, and the
difficulty of the science.


THE OBJECT OF MATHEMATICS.

_Measuring Magnitudes._ The question of _measuring_ a magnitude in
itself presents to the mind no other idea than that of the simple direct
comparison of this magnitude with another similar magnitude, supposed to
be known, which it takes for the _unit_ of comparison among all others
of the same kind. According to this definition, then, the science of
mathematics--vast and profound as it is with reason reputed to
be--instead of being an immense concatenation of prolonged mental
labours, which offer inexhaustible occupation to our intellectual
activity, would seem to consist of a simple series of mechanical
processes for obtaining directly the ratios of the quantities to be
measured to those by which we wish to measure them, by the aid of
operations of similar character to the superposition of lines, as
practiced by the carpenter with his rule.

The error of this definition consists in presenting as direct an object
which is almost always, on the contrary, very indirect. The _direct_
measurement of a magnitude, by superposition or any similar process, is
most frequently an operation quite impossible for us to perform; so that
if we had no other means for determining magnitudes than direct
comparisons, we should be obliged to renounce the knowledge of most of
those which interest us.

_Difficulties._ The force of this general observation will be understood
if we limit ourselves to consider specially the particular case which
evidently offers the most facility--that of the measurement of one
straight line by another. This comparison, which is certainly the most
simple which we can conceive, can nevertheless scarcely ever be effected
directly. In reflecting on the whole of the conditions necessary to
render a line susceptible of a direct measurement, we see that most
frequently they cannot be all fulfilled at the same time. The first and
the most palpable of these conditions--that of being able to pass over
the line from one end of it to the other, in order to apply the unit of
measurement to its whole length--evidently excludes at once by far the
greater part of the distances which interest us the most; in the first
place, all the distances between the celestial bodies, or from any one
of them to the earth; and then, too, even the greater number of
terrestrial distances, which are so frequently inaccessible. But even if
this first condition be found to be fulfilled, it is still farther
necessary that the length be neither too great nor too small, which
would render a direct measurement equally impossible. The line must also
be suitably situated; for let it be one which we could measure with the
greatest facility, if it were horizontal, but conceive it to be turned
up vertically, and it becomes impossible to measure it.

The difficulties which we have indicated in reference to measuring
lines, exist in a very much greater degree in the measurement of
surfaces, volumes, velocities, times, forces, &c. It is this fact which
makes necessary the formation of mathematical science, as we are going
to see; for the human mind has been compelled to renounce, in almost all
cases, the direct measurement of magnitudes, and to seek to determine
them _indirectly_, and it is thus that it has been led to the creation
of mathematics.

_General Method._ The general method which is constantly employed, and
evidently the only one conceivable, to ascertain magnitudes which do not
admit of a direct measurement, consists in connecting them with others
which are susceptible of being determined immediately, and by means of
which we succeed in discovering the first through the relations which
subsist between the two. Such is the precise object of mathematical
science viewed as a whole. In order to form a sufficiently extended idea
of it, we must consider that this indirect determination of magnitudes
may be indirect in very different degrees. In a great number of cases,
which are often the most important, the magnitudes, by means of which
the principal magnitudes sought are to be determined, cannot themselves
be measured directly, and must therefore, in their turn, become the
subject of a similar question, and so on; so that on many occasions the
human mind is obliged to establish a long series of intermediates
between the system of unknown magnitudes which are the final objects of
its researches, and the system of magnitudes susceptible of direct
measurement, by whose means we finally determine the first, with which
at first they appear to have no connexion.

_Illustrations._ Some examples will make clear any thing which may seem
too abstract in the preceding generalities.

1. _Falling Bodies._ Let us consider, in the first place, a natural
phenomenon, very simple, indeed, but which may nevertheless give rise to
a mathematical question, really existing, and susceptible of actual
applications--the phenomenon of the vertical fall of heavy bodies.

The mind the most unused to mathematical conceptions, in observing this
phenomenon, perceives at once that the two _quantities_ which it
presents--namely, the _height_ from which a body has fallen, and the
_time_ of its fall--are necessarily connected with each other, since
they vary together, and simultaneously remain fixed; or, in the language
of geometers, that they are "_functions_" of each other. The phenomenon,
considered under this point of view, gives rise then to a mathematical
question, which consists in substituting for the direct measurement of
one of these two magnitudes, when it is impossible, the measurement of
the other. It is thus, for example, that we may determine indirectly the
depth of a precipice, by merely measuring the time that a heavy body
would occupy in falling to its bottom, and by suitable procedures this
inaccessible depth will be known with as much precision as if it was a
horizontal line placed in the most favourable circumstances for easy and
exact measurement. On other occasions it is the height from which a body
has fallen which it will be easy to ascertain, while the time of the
fall could not be observed directly; then the same phenomenon would give
rise to the inverse question, namely, to determine the time from the
height; as, for example, if we wished to ascertain what would be the
duration of the vertical fall of a body falling from the moon to the
earth.

In this example the mathematical question is very simple, at least when
we do not pay attention to the variation in the intensity of gravity, or
the resistance of the fluid which the body passes through in its fall.
But, to extend the question, we have only to consider the same
phenomenon in its greatest generality, in supposing the fall oblique,
and in taking into the account all the principal circumstances. Then,
instead of offering simply two variable quantities connected with each
other by a relation easy to follow, the phenomenon will present a much
greater number; namely, the space traversed, whether in a vertical or
horizontal direction; the time employed in traversing it; the velocity
of the body at each point of its course; even the intensity and the
direction of its primitive impulse, which may also be viewed as
variables; and finally, in certain cases (to take every thing into the
account), the resistance of the medium and the intensity of gravity. All
these different quantities will be connected with one another, in such a
way that each in its turn may be indirectly determined by means of the
others; and this will present as many distinct mathematical questions as
there may be co-existing magnitudes in the phenomenon under
consideration. Such a very slight change in the physical conditions of a
problem may cause (as in the above example) a mathematical research, at
first very elementary, to be placed at once in the rank of the most
difficult questions, whose complete and rigorous solution surpasses as
yet the utmost power of the human intellect.

2. _Inaccessible Distances._ Let us take a second example from
geometrical phenomena. Let it be proposed to determine a distance which
is not susceptible of direct measurement; it will be generally conceived
as making part of a _figure_, or certain system of lines, chosen in such
a way that all its other parts may be observed directly; thus, in the
case which is most simple, and to which all the others may be finally
reduced, the proposed distance will be considered as belonging to a
triangle, in which we can determine directly either another side and two
angles, or two sides and one angle. Thence-forward, the knowledge of the
desired distance, instead of being obtained directly, will be the result
of a mathematical calculation, which will consist in deducing it from
the observed elements by means of the relation which connects it with
them. This calculation will become successively more and more
complicated, if the parts which we have supposed to be known cannot
themselves be determined (as is most frequently the case) except in an
indirect manner, by the aid of new auxiliary systems, the number of
which, in great operations of this kind, finally becomes very
considerable. The distance being once determined, the knowledge of it
will frequently be sufficient for obtaining new quantities, which will
become the subject of new mathematical questions. Thus, when we know at
what distance any object is situated, the simple observation of its
apparent diameter will evidently permit us to determine indirectly its
real dimensions, however inaccessible it may be, and, by a series of
analogous investigations, its surface, its volume, even its weight, and
a number of other properties, a knowledge of which seemed forbidden to
us.

3. _Astronomical Facts._ It is by such calculations that man has been
able to ascertain, not only the distances from the planets to the earth,
and, consequently, from each other, but their actual magnitude, their
true figure, even to the inequalities of their surface; and, what seemed
still more completely hidden from us, their respective masses, their
mean densities, the principal circumstances of the fall of heavy bodies
on the surface of each of them, &c.

By the power of mathematical theories, all these different results, and
many others relative to the different classes of mathematical phenomena,
have required no other direct measurements than those of a very small
number of straight lines, suitably chosen, and of a greater number of
angles. We may even say, with perfect truth, so as to indicate in a word
the general range of the science, that if we did not fear to multiply
calculations unnecessarily, and if we had not, in consequence, to
reserve them for the determination of the quantities which could not be
measured directly, the determination of all the magnitudes susceptible
of precise estimation, which the various orders of phenomena can offer
us, could be finally reduced to the direct measurement of a single
straight line and of a suitable number of angles.


TRUE DEFINITION OF MATHEMATICS.

We are now able to define mathematical science with precision, by
assigning to it as its object the _indirect_ measurement of magnitudes,
and by saying it constantly proposes _to determine certain magnitudes
from others by means of the precise relations existing between them_.

This enunciation, instead of giving the idea of only an _art_, as do all
the ordinary definitions, characterizes immediately a true _science_,
and shows it at once to be composed of an immense chain of intellectual
operations, which may evidently become very complicated, because of the
series of intermediate links which it will be necessary to establish
between the unknown quantities and those which admit of a direct
measurement; of the number of variables coexistent in the proposed
question; and of the nature of the relations between all these different
magnitudes furnished by the phenomena under consideration. According to
such a definition, the spirit of mathematics consists in always
regarding all the quantities which any phenomenon can present, as
connected and interwoven with one another, with the view of deducing
them from one another. Now there is evidently no phenomenon which cannot
give rise to considerations of this kind; whence results the naturally
indefinite extent and even the rigorous logical universality of
mathematical science. We shall seek farther on to circumscribe as
exactly as possible its real extension.

The preceding explanations establish clearly the propriety of the name
employed to designate the science which we are considering. This
denomination, which has taken to-day so definite a meaning by itself
signifies simply _science_ in general. Such a designation, rigorously
exact for the Greeks, who had no other real science, could be retained
by the moderns only to indicate the mathematics as _the_ science, beyond
all others--the science of sciences.

Indeed, every true science has for its object the determination of
certain phenomena by means of others, in accordance with the relations
which exist between them. Every _science_ consists in the co-ordination
of facts; if the different observations were entirely isolated, there
would be no science. We may even say, in general terms, that _science_
is essentially destined to dispense, so far as the different phenomena
permit it, with all direct observation, by enabling us to deduce from
the smallest possible number of immediate data the greatest possible
number of results. Is not this the real use, whether in speculation or
in action, of the _laws_ which we succeed in discovering among natural
phenomena? Mathematical science, in this point of view, merely pushes to
the highest possible degree the same kind of researches which are
pursued, in degrees more or less inferior, by every real science in its
respective sphere.


ITS TWO FUNDAMENTAL DIVISIONS.

We have thus far viewed mathematical science only as a whole, without
paying any regard to its divisions. We must now, in order to complete
this general view, and to form a just idea of the philosophical
character of the science, consider its fundamental division. The
secondary divisions will be examined in the following chapters.

This principal division, which we are about to investigate, can be
truly rational, and derived from the real nature of the subject, only so
far as it spontaneously presents itself to us, in making the exact
analysis of a complete mathematical question. We will, therefore, having
determined above what is the general object of mathematical labours, now
characterize with precision the principal different orders of inquiries,
of which they are constantly composed.

_Their different Objects._ The complete solution of every mathematical
question divides itself necessarily into two parts, of natures
essentially distinct, and with relations invariably determinate. We have
seen that every mathematical inquiry has for its object to determine
unknown magnitudes, according to the relations between them and known
magnitudes. Now for this object, it is evidently necessary, in the first
place, to ascertain with precision the relations which exist between the
quantities which we are considering. This first branch of inquiries
constitutes that which I call the _concrete_ part of the solution. When
it is finished, the question changes; it is now reduced to a pure
question of numbers, consisting simply in determining unknown numbers,
when we know what precise relations connect them with known numbers.
This second branch of inquiries is what I call the _abstract_ part of
the solution. Hence follows the fundamental division of general
mathematical science into _two_ great sciences--ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS,
and CONCRETE MATHEMATICS.

This analysis may be observed in every complete mathematical question,
however simple or complicated it may be. A single example will suffice
to make it intelligible.

Taking up again the phenomenon of the vertical fall of a heavy body, and
considering the simplest case, we see that in order to succeed in
determining, by means of one another, the height whence the body has
fallen, and the duration of its fall, we must commence by discovering
the exact relation of these two quantities, or, to use the language of
geometers, the _equation_ which exists between them. Before this first
research is completed, every attempt to determine numerically the value
of one of these two magnitudes from the other would evidently be
premature, for it would have no basis. It is not enough to know vaguely
that they depend on one another--which every one at once perceives--but
it is necessary to determine in what this dependence consists. This
inquiry may be very difficult, and in fact, in the present case,
constitutes incomparably the greater part of the problem. The true
scientific spirit is so modern, that no one, perhaps, before Galileo,
had ever remarked the increase of velocity which a body experiences in
its fall: a circumstance which excludes the hypothesis, towards which
our mind (always involuntarily inclined to suppose in every phenomenon
the most simple _functions_, without any other motive than its greater
facility in conceiving them) would be naturally led, that the height was
proportional to the time. In a word, this first inquiry terminated in
the discovery of the law of Galileo.

When this _concrete_ part is completed, the inquiry becomes one of quite
another nature. Knowing that the spaces passed through by the body in
each successive second of its fall increase as the series of odd
numbers, we have then a problem purely numerical and _abstract_; to
deduce the height from the time, or the time from the height; and this
consists in finding that the first of these two quantities, according to
the law which has been established, is a known multiple of the second
power of the other; from which, finally, we have to calculate the value
of the one when that of the other is given.

In this example the concrete question is more difficult than the
abstract one. The reverse would be the case if we considered the same
phenomenon in its greatest generality, as I have done above for another
object. According to the circumstances, sometimes the first, sometimes
the second, of these two parts will constitute the principal difficulty
of the whole question; for the mathematical law of the phenomenon may be
very simple, but very difficult to obtain, or it may be easy to
discover, but very complicated; so that the two great sections of
mathematical science, when we compare them as wholes, must be regarded
as exactly equivalent in extent and in difficulty, as well as in
importance, as we shall show farther on, in considering each of them
separately.

_Their different Natures._ These two parts, essentially distinct in
their _object_, as we have just seen, are no less so with regard to the
_nature_ of the inquiries of which they are composed.

The first should be called _concrete_, since it evidently depends on the
character of the phenomena considered, and must necessarily vary when we
examine new phenomena; while the second is completely independent of the
nature of the objects examined, and is concerned with only the
_numerical_ relations which they present, for which reason it should be
called _abstract_. The same relations may exist in a great number of
different phenomena, which, in spite of their extreme diversity, will
be viewed by the geometer as offering an analytical question
susceptible, when studied by itself, of being resolved once for all.
Thus, for instance, the same law which exists between the space and the
time of the vertical fall of a body in a vacuum, is found again in many
other phenomena which offer no analogy with the first nor with each
other; for it expresses the relation between the surface of a spherical
body and the length of its diameter; it determines, in like manner, the
decrease of the intensity of light or of heat in relation to the
distance of the objects lighted or heated, &c. The abstract part, common
to these different mathematical questions, having been treated in
reference to one of these, will thus have been treated for all; while
the concrete part will have necessarily to be again taken up for each
question separately, without the solution of any one of them being able
to give any direct aid, in that connexion, for the solution of the rest.

The abstract part of mathematics is, then, general in its nature; the
concrete part, special.

To present this comparison under a new point of view, we may say
concrete mathematics has a philosophical character, which is essentially
experimental, physical, phenomenal; while that of abstract mathematics
is purely logical, rational. The concrete part of every mathematical
question is necessarily founded on the consideration of the external
world, and could never be resolved by a simple series of intellectual
combinations. The abstract part, on the contrary, when it has been very
completely separated, can consist only of a series of logical
deductions, more or less prolonged; for if we have once found the
equations of a phenomenon, the determination of the quantities therein
considered, by means of one another, is a matter for reasoning only,
whatever the difficulties may be. It belongs to the understanding alone
to deduce from these equations results which are evidently contained in
them, although perhaps in a very involved manner, without there being
occasion to consult anew the external world; the consideration of which,
having become thenceforth foreign to the subject, ought even to be
carefully set aside in order to reduce the labour to its true peculiar
difficulty. The _abstract_ part of mathematics is then purely
instrumental, and is only an immense and admirable extension of natural
logic to a certain class of deductions. On the other hand, geometry and
mechanics, which, as we shall see presently, constitute the _concrete_
part, must be viewed as real natural sciences, founded on observation,
like all the rest, although the extreme simplicity of their phenomena
permits an infinitely greater degree of systematization, which has
sometimes caused a misconception of the experimental character of their
first principles.

We see, by this brief general comparison, how natural and profound is
our fundamental division of mathematical science.

We have now to circumscribe, as exactly as we can in this first sketch,
each of these two great sections.


CONCRETE MATHEMATICS.

_Concrete Mathematics_ having for its object the discovery of the
_equations_ of phenomena, it would seem at first that it must be
composed of as many distinct sciences as we find really distinct
categories among natural phenomena. But we are yet very far from having
discovered mathematical laws in all kinds of phenomena; we shall even
see, presently, that the greater part will very probably always hide
themselves from our investigations. In reality, in the present condition
of the human mind, there are directly but two great general classes of
phenomena, whose equations we constantly know; these are, firstly,
geometrical, and, secondly, mechanical phenomena. Thus, then, the
concrete part of mathematics is composed of GEOMETRY and RATIONAL
MECHANICS.

This is sufficient, it is true, to give to it a complete character of
logical universality, when we consider all phenomena from the most
elevated point of view of natural philosophy. In fact, if all the parts
of the universe were conceived as immovable, we should evidently have
only geometrical phenomena to observe, since all would be reduced to
relations of form, magnitude, and position; then, having regard to the
motions which take place in it, we would have also to consider
mechanical phenomena. Hence the universe, in the statical point of view,
presents only geometrical phenomena; and, considered dynamically, only
mechanical phenomena. Thus geometry and mechanics constitute the two
fundamental natural sciences, in this sense, that all natural effects
may be conceived as simple necessary results, either of the laws of
extension or of the laws of motion.

But although this conception is always logically possible, the
difficulty is to specialize it with the necessary precision, and to
follow it exactly in each of the general cases offered to us by the
study of nature; that is, to effectually reduce each principal question
of natural philosophy, for a certain determinate order of phenomena, to
the question of geometry or mechanics, to which we might rationally
suppose it should be brought. This transformation, which requires great
progress to have been previously made in the study of each class of
phenomena, has thus far been really executed only for those of
astronomy, and for a part of those considered by terrestrial physics,
properly so called. It is thus that astronomy, acoustics, optics, &c.,
have finally become applications of mathematical science to certain
orders of observations.[1] But these applications not being by their
nature rigorously circumscribed, to confound them with the science would
be to assign to it a vague and indefinite domain; and this is done in
the usual division, so faulty in so many other respects, of the
mathematics into "Pure" and "Applied."

  [Footnote 1: The investigation of the mathematical phenomena of the
  laws of heat by Baron Fourier has led to the establishment, in an
  entirely direct manner, of Thermological equations. This great
  discovery tends to elevate our philosophical hopes as to the future
  extensions of the legitimate applications of mathematical analysis,
  and renders it proper, in the opinion of author, to regard
  _Thermology_ as a third principal branch of concrete mathematics.]


ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS.

The nature of abstract mathematics (the general division of which will
be examined in the following chapter) is clearly and exactly determined.
It is composed of what is called the _Calculus_,[2] taking this word in
its greatest extent, which reaches from the most simple numerical
operations to the most sublime combinations of transcendental analysis.
The _Calculus_ has the solution of all questions relating to numbers
for its peculiar object. Its _starting point_ is, constantly and
necessarily, the knowledge of the precise relations, _i.e._, of the
_equations_, between the different magnitudes which are simultaneously
considered; that which is, on the contrary, the _stopping point_ of
concrete mathematics. However complicated, or however indirect these
relations may be, the final object of the calculus always is to obtain
from them the values of the unknown quantities by means of those which
are known. This _science_, although nearer perfection than any other, is
really little advanced as yet, so that this object is rarely attained in
a manner completely satisfactory.

  [Footnote 2: The translator has felt justified in employing this
  very convenient word (for which our language has no precise
  equivalent) as an English one, in its most extended sense, in spite
  of its being often popularly confounded with its Differential and
  Integral department.]

Mathematical analysis is, then, the true rational basis of the entire
system of our actual knowledge. It constitutes the first and the most
perfect of all the fundamental sciences. The ideas with which it
occupies itself are the most universal, the most abstract, and the most
simple which it is possible for us to conceive.

This peculiar nature of mathematical analysis enables us easily to
explain why, when it is properly employed, it is such a powerful
instrument, not only to give more precision to our real knowledge, which
is self-evident, but especially to establish an infinitely more perfect
co-ordination in the study of the phenomena which admit of that
application; for, our conceptions having been so generalized and
simplified that a single analytical question, abstractly resolved,
contains the _implicit_ solution of a great number of diverse physical
questions, the human mind must necessarily acquire by these means a
greater facility in perceiving relations between phenomena which at
first appeared entirely distinct from one another. We thus naturally see
arise, through the medium of analysis, the most frequent and the most
unexpected approximations between problems which at first offered no
apparent connection, and which we often end in viewing as identical.
Could we, for example, without the aid of analysis, perceive the least
resemblance between the determination of the direction of a curve at
each of its points and that of the velocity acquired by a body at every
instant of its variable motion? and yet these questions, however
different they may be, compose but one in the eyes of the geometer.

The high relative perfection of mathematical analysis is as easily
perceptible. This perfection is not due, as some have thought, to the
nature of the signs which are employed as instruments of reasoning,
eminently concise and general as they are. In reality, all great
analytical ideas have been formed without the algebraic signs having
been of any essential aid, except for working them out after the mind
had conceived them. The superior perfection of the science of the
calculus is due principally to the extreme simplicity of the ideas which
it considers, by whatever signs they may be expressed; so that there is
not the least hope, by any artifice of scientific language, of
perfecting to the same degree theories which refer to more complex
subjects, and which are necessarily condemned by their nature to a
greater or less logical inferiority.


THE EXTENT OF ITS FIELD.

Our examination of the philosophical character of mathematical science
would remain incomplete, if, after having viewed its object and
composition, we did not examine the real extent of its domain.

_Its Universality_. For this purpose it is indispensable to perceive,
first of all, that, in the purely logical point of view, this science is
by itself necessarily and rigorously universal; for there is no question
whatever which may not be finally conceived as consisting in determining
certain quantities from others by means of certain relations, and
consequently as admitting of reduction, in final analysis, to a simple
question of numbers. In all our researches, indeed, on whatever subject,
our object is to arrive at numbers, at quantities, though often in a
very imperfect manner and by very uncertain methods. Thus, taking an
example in the class of subjects the least accessible to mathematics,
the phenomena of living bodies, even when considered (to take the most
complicated case) in the state of disease, is it not manifest that all
the questions of therapeutics may be viewed as consisting in determining
the _quantities_ of the different agents which modify the organism, and
which must act upon it to bring it to its normal state, admitting, for
some of these quantities in certain cases, values which are equal to
zero, or negative, or even contradictory?

The fundamental idea of Descartes on the relation of the concrete to the
abstract in mathematics, has proven, in opposition to the superficial
distinction of metaphysics, that all ideas of quality may be reduced to
those of quantity. This conception, established at first by its immortal
author in relation to geometrical phenomena only, has since been
effectually extended to mechanical phenomena, and in our days to those
of heat. As a result of this gradual generalization, there are now no
geometers who do not consider it, in a purely theoretical sense, as
capable of being applied to all our real ideas of every sort, so that
every phenomenon is logically susceptible of being represented by an
_equation_; as much so, indeed, as is a curve or a motion, excepting the
difficulty of discovering it, and then of _resolving_ it, which may be,
and oftentimes are, superior to the greatest powers of the human mind.

_Its Limitations_. Important as it is to comprehend the rigorous
universality, in a logical point of view, of mathematical science, it is
no less indispensable to consider now the great real _limitations_,
which, through the feebleness of our intellect, narrow in a remarkable
degree its actual domain, in proportion as phenomena, in becoming
special, become complicated.

Every question may be conceived as capable of being reduced to a pure
question of numbers; but the difficulty of effecting such a
transformation increases so much with the complication of the phenomena
of natural philosophy, that it soon becomes insurmountable.

This will be easily seen, if we consider that to bring a question within
the field of mathematical analysis, we must first have discovered the
precise relations which exist between the quantities which are found in
the phenomenon under examination, the establishment of these equations
being the necessary starting point of all analytical labours. This must
evidently be so much the more difficult as we have to do with phenomena
which are more special, and therefore more complicated. We shall thus
find that it is only in _inorganic physics_, at the most, that we can
justly hope ever to obtain that high degree of scientific perfection.

The _first_ condition which is necessary in order that phenomena may
admit of mathematical laws, susceptible of being discovered, evidently
is, that their different quantities should admit of being expressed by
fixed numbers. We soon find that in this respect the whole of _organic
physics_, and probably also the most complicated parts of inorganic
physics, are necessarily inaccessible, by their nature, to our
mathematical analysis, by reason of the extreme numerical variability of
the corresponding phenomena. Every precise idea of fixed numbers is
truly out of place in the phenomena of living bodies, when we wish to
employ it otherwise than as a means of relieving the attention, and when
we attach any importance to the exact relations of the values assigned.

We ought not, however, on this account, to cease to conceive all
phenomena as being necessarily subject to mathematical laws, which we
are condemned to be ignorant of, only because of the too great
complication of the phenomena. The most complex phenomena of living
bodies are doubtless essentially of no other special nature than the
simplest phenomena of unorganized matter. If it were possible to isolate
rigorously each of the simple causes which concur in producing a single
physiological phenomenon, every thing leads us to believe that it would
show itself endowed, in determinate circumstances, with a kind of
influence and with a quantity of action as exactly fixed as we see it in
universal gravitation, a veritable type of the fundamental laws of
nature.

There is a _second_ reason why we cannot bring complicated phenomena
under the dominion of mathematical analysis. Even if we could ascertain
the mathematical law which governs each agent, taken by itself, the
combination of so great a number of conditions would render the
corresponding mathematical problem so far above our feeble means, that
the question would remain in most cases incapable of solution.

To appreciate this difficulty, let us consider how complicated
mathematical questions become, even those relating to the most simple
phenomena of unorganized bodies, when we desire to bring sufficiently
near together the abstract and the concrete state, having regard to all
the principal conditions which can exercise a real influence over the
effect produced. We know, for example, that the very simple phenomenon
of the flow of a fluid through a given orifice, by virtue of its gravity
alone, has not as yet any complete mathematical solution, when we take
into the account all the essential circumstances. It is the same even
with the still more simple motion of a solid projectile in a resisting
medium.

Why has mathematical analysis been able to adapt itself with such
admirable success to the most profound study of celestial phenomena?
Because they are, in spite of popular appearances, much more simple than
any others. The most complicated problem which they present, that of the
modification produced in the motions of two bodies tending towards each
other by virtue of their gravitation, by the influence of a third body
acting on both of them in the same manner, is much less complex than the
most simple terrestrial problem. And, nevertheless, even it presents
difficulties so great that we yet possess only approximate solutions of
it. It is even easy to see that the high perfection to which solar
astronomy has been able to elevate itself by the employment of
mathematical science is, besides, essentially due to our having
skilfully profited by all the particular, and, so to say, accidental
facilities presented by the peculiarly favourable constitution of our
planetary system. The planets which compose it are quite few in number,
and their masses are in general very unequal, and much less than that of
the sun; they are, besides, very distant from one another; they have
forms almost spherical; their orbits are nearly circular, and only
slightly inclined to each other, and so on. It results from all these
circumstances that the perturbations are generally inconsiderable, and
that to calculate them it is usually sufficient to take into the
account, in connexion with the action of the sun on each particular
planet, the influence of only one other planet, capable, by its size and
its proximity, of causing perceptible derangements.

If, however, instead of such a state of things, our solar system had
been composed of a greater number of planets concentrated into a less
space, and nearly equal in mass; if their orbits had presented very
different inclinations, and considerable eccentricities; if these bodies
had been of a more complicated form, such as very eccentric ellipsoids,
it is certain that, supposing the same law of gravitation to exist, we
should not yet have succeeded in subjecting the study of the celestial
phenomena to our mathematical analysis, and probably we should not even
have been able to disentangle the present principal law.

These hypothetical conditions would find themselves exactly realized in
the highest degree in _chemical_ phenomena, if we attempted to calculate
them by the theory of general gravitation.

On properly weighing the preceding considerations, the reader will be
convinced, I think, that in reducing the future extension of the great
applications of mathematical analysis, which are really possible, to
the field comprised in the different departments of inorganic physics, I
have rather exaggerated than contracted the extent of its actual domain.
Important as it was to render apparent the rigorous logical universality
of mathematical science, it was equally so to indicate the conditions
which limit for us its real extension, so as not to contribute to lead
the human mind astray from the true scientific direction in the study of
the most complicated phenomena, by the chimerical search after an
impossible perfection.

Having thus exhibited the essential object and the principal composition
of mathematical science, as well as its general relations with the whole
body of natural philosophy, we have now to pass to the special
examination of the great sciences of which it is composed.

     _Note._--ANALYSIS and GEOMETRY are the two great heads under which
     the subject is about to be examined. To these _M. Comte_ adds
     Rational MECHANICS; but as it is not comprised in the usual idea of
     Mathematics, and as its discussion would be of but limited utility
     and interest, it is not included in the present translation.

CHAPTER I.

GENERAL VIEW OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS.


In the historical development of mathematical science since the time of
Descartes, the advances of its abstract portion have always been
determined by those of its concrete portion; but it is none the less
necessary, in order to conceive the science in a manner truly logical,
to consider the Calculus in all its principal branches before proceeding
to the philosophical study of Geometry and Mechanics. Its analytical
theories, more simple and more general than those of concrete
mathematics, are in themselves essentially independent of the latter;
while these, on the contrary, have, by their nature, a continual need of
the former, without the aid of which they could make scarcely any
progress. Although the principal conceptions of analysis retain at
present some very perceptible traces of their geometrical or mechanical
origin, they are now, however, mainly freed from that primitive
character, which no longer manifests itself except in some secondary
points; so that it is possible (especially since the labours of
Lagrange) to present them in a dogmatic exposition, by a purely abstract
method, in a single and continuous system. It is this which will be
undertaken in the present and the five following chapters, limiting our
investigations to the most general considerations upon each principal
branch of the science of the calculus.

The definite object of our researches in concrete mathematics being the
discovery of the _equations_ which express the mathematical laws of the
phenomenon under consideration, and these equations constituting the
true starting point of the calculus, which has for its object to obtain
from them the determination of certain quantities by means of others, I
think it indispensable, before proceeding any farther, to go more deeply
than has been customary into that fundamental idea of _equation_, the
continual subject, either as end or as beginning, of all mathematical
labours. Besides the advantage of circumscribing more definitely the
true field of analysis, there will result from it the important
consequence of tracing in a more exact manner the real line of
demarcation between the concrete and the abstract part of mathematics,
which will complete the general exposition of the fundamental division
established in the introductory chapter.




THE TRUE IDEA OF AN EQUATION.


We usually form much too vague an idea of what an _equation_ is, when we
give that name to every kind of relation of equality between _any_ two
functions of the magnitudes which we are considering. For, though every
equation is evidently a relation of equality, it is far from being true
that, reciprocally, every relation of equality is a veritable
_equation_, of the kind of those to which, by their nature, the methods
of analysis are applicable.

This want of precision in the logical consideration of an idea which is
so fundamental in mathematics, brings with it the serious inconvenience
of rendering it almost impossible to explain, in general terms, the
great and fundamental difficulty which we find in establishing the
relation between the concrete and the abstract, and which stands out so
prominently in each great mathematical question taken by itself. If the
meaning of the word _equation_ was truly as extended as we habitually
suppose it to be in our definition of it, it is not apparent what great
difficulty there could really be, in general, in establishing the
equations of any problem whatsoever; for the whole would thus appear to
consist in a simple question of form, which ought never even to exact
any great intellectual efforts, seeing that we can hardly conceive of
any precise relation which is not immediately a certain relation of
equality, or which cannot be readily brought thereto by some very easy
transformations.

Thus, when we admit every species of _functions_ into the definition of
_equations_, we do not at all account for the extreme difficulty which
we almost always experience in putting a problem into an equation, and
which so often may be compared to the efforts required by the analytical
elaboration of the equation when once obtained. In a word, the ordinary
abstract and general idea of an _equation_ does not at all correspond to
the real meaning which geometers attach to that expression in the actual
development of the science. Here, then, is a logical fault, a defect of
correlation, which it is very important to rectify.


_Division of Functions into Abstract and Concrete._ To succeed in doing
so, I begin by distinguishing two sorts of _functions_, _abstract_ or
analytical functions, and _concrete_ functions. The first alone can
enter into veritable _equations_. We may, therefore, henceforth define
every _equation_, in an exact and sufficiently profound manner, as a
relation of equality between two _abstract_ functions of the magnitudes
under consideration. In order not to have to return again to this
fundamental definition, I must add here, as an indispensable complement,
without which the idea would not be sufficiently general, that these
abstract functions may refer not only to the magnitudes which the
problem presents of itself, but also to all the other auxiliary
magnitudes which are connected with it, and which we will often be able
to introduce, simply as a mathematical artifice, with the sole object of
facilitating the discovery of the equations of the phenomena. I here
anticipate summarily the result of a general discussion of the highest
importance, which will be found at the end of this chapter. We will now
return to the essential distinction of functions as abstract and
concrete.

This distinction may be established in two ways, essentially different,
but complementary of each other, _à priori_ and _à posteriori_; that is
to say, by characterizing in a general manner the peculiar nature of
each species of functions, and then by making the actual enumeration of
all the abstract functions at present known, at least so far as relates
to the elements of which they are composed.

_À priori_, the functions which I call _abstract_ are those which
express a manner of dependence between magnitudes, which can be
conceived between numbers alone, without there being need of indicating
any phenomenon whatever in which it is realized. I name, on the other
hand, _concrete_ functions, those for which the mode of dependence
expressed cannot be defined or conceived except by assigning a
determinate case of physics, geometry, mechanics, &c., in which it
actually exists.

Most functions in their origin, even those which are at present the most
purely _abstract_, have begun by being _concrete_; so that it is easy to
make the preceding distinction understood, by citing only the successive
different points of view under which, in proportion as the science has
become formed, geometers have considered the most simple analytical
functions. I will indicate powers, for example, which have in general
become abstract functions only since the labours of Vieta and Descartes.
The functions _x²_, _x³_, which in our present analysis are so well
conceived as simply _abstract_, were, for the geometers of antiquity,
perfectly _concrete_ functions, expressing the relation of the
superficies of a square, or the volume of a cube to the length of their
side. These had in their eyes such a character so exclusively, that it
was only by means of the geometrical definitions that they discovered
the elementary algebraic properties of these functions, relating to the
decomposition of the variable into two parts, properties which were at
that epoch only real theorems of geometry, to which a numerical meaning
was not attached until long afterward.

I shall have occasion to cite presently, for another reason, a new
example, very suitable to make apparent the fundamental distinction
which I have just exhibited; it is that of circular functions, both
direct and inverse, which at the present time are still sometimes
concrete, sometimes abstract, according to the point of view under
which they are regarded.

_À posteriori_, the general character which renders a function abstract
or concrete having been established, the question as to whether a
certain determinate function is veritably abstract, and therefore
susceptible of entering into true analytical equations, becomes a simple
question of fact, inasmuch as we are going to enumerate all the
functions of this species.


_Enumeration of Abstract Functions._ At first view this enumeration
seems impossible, the distinct analytical functions being infinite in
number. But when we divide them into _simple_ and _compound_, the
difficulty disappears; for, though the number of the different functions
considered in mathematical analysis is really infinite, they are, on the
contrary, even at the present day, composed of a very small number of
elementary functions, which can be easily assigned, and which are
evidently sufficient for deciding the abstract or concrete character of
any given function; which will be of the one or the other nature,
according as it shall be composed exclusively of these simple abstract
functions, or as it shall include others.

We evidently have to consider, for this purpose, only the functions of a
single variable, since those relative to several independent variables
are constantly, by their nature, more or less _compound_.

Let _x_ be the independent variable, _y_ the correlative variable which
depends upon it. The different simple modes of abstract dependence,
which we can now conceive between _y_ and _x_, are expressed by the ten
following elementary formulas, in which each function is coupled with
its _inverse_, that is, with that which would be obtained from the
direct function by referring _x_ to _y_, instead of referring _y_ to
_x_.

            FUNCTION.                   ITS NAME.

1st couple {1° _y_ = _a_ + _x_             _Sum._
           {2° _y_ = _a_ - _x_             _Difference._

2d couple  {1° _y_ = _ax_                  _Product._
           {2° _y_ = _a/x_                 _Quotient._

3d couple  {1° _y_ = _x^a_                 _Power._
           {2° _y_ = _[ath root]x_            _Root._

4th couple {1° _y_ = _a^x_                 _Exponential._
           {2° _y_ = _[log a]x_            _Logarithmic._

5th couple {1° _y_ = sin. _x_              _Direct Circular._
           {2° _y_ = arc(sin. = _x_).      _Inverse Circular._[3]

  [Footnote 3: With the view of increasing as much as possible the
  resources and the extent (now so insufficient) of mathematical
  analysis, geometers count this last couple of functions among the
  analytical elements. Although this inscription is strictly
  legitimate, it is important to remark that circular functions are
  not exactly in the same situation as the other abstract elementary
  functions. There is this very essential difference, that the
  functions of the four first couples are at the same time simple and
  abstract, while the circular functions, which may manifest each
  character in succession, according to the point of view under which
  they are considered and the manner in which they are employed,
  never present these two properties simultaneously.

  Some other concrete functions may be usefully introduced into the
  number of analytical elements, certain conditions being fulfilled.
  It is thus, for example, that the labours of M. Legendre and of M.
  Jacobi on _elliptical_ functions have truly enlarged the field of
  analysis; and the same is true of some definite integrals obtained
  by M. Fourier in the theory of heat.]

Such are the elements, very few in number, which directly compose all
the abstract functions known at the present day. Few as they are, they
are evidently sufficient to give rise to an infinite number of
analytical combinations.

No rational consideration rigorously circumscribes, _à priori_, the
preceding table, which is only the actual expression of the present
state of the science. Our analytical elements are at the present day
more numerous than they were for Descartes, and even for Newton and
Leibnitz: it is only a century since the last two couples have been
introduced into analysis by the labours of John Bernouilli and Euler.
Doubtless new ones will be hereafter admitted; but, as I shall show
towards the end of this chapter, we cannot hope that they will ever be
greatly multiplied, their real augmentation giving rise to very great
difficulties.

We can now form a definite, and, at the same time, sufficiently extended
idea of what geometers understand by a veritable _equation_. This
explanation is especially suited to make us understand how difficult it
must be really to establish the _equations_ of phenomena, since we have
effectually succeeded in so doing only when we have been able to
conceive the mathematical laws of these phenomena by the aid of
functions entirely composed of only the mathematical elements which I
have just enumerated. It is clear, in fact, that it is then only that
the problem becomes truly abstract, and is reduced to a pure question of
numbers, these functions being the only simple relations which we can
conceive between numbers, considered by themselves. Up to this period of
the solution, whatever the appearances may be, the question is still
essentially concrete, and does not come within the domain of the
_calculus_. Now the fundamental difficulty of this passage from the
_concrete_ to the _abstract_ in general consists especially in the
insufficiency of this very small number of analytical elements which we
possess, and by means of which, nevertheless, in spite of the little
real variety which they offer us, we must succeed in representing all
the precise relations which all the different natural phenomena can
manifest to us. Considering the infinite diversity which must
necessarily exist in this respect in the external world, we easily
understand how far below the true difficulty our conceptions must
frequently be found, especially if we add that as these elements of our
analysis have been in the first place furnished to us by the
mathematical consideration of the simplest phenomena, we have, _à
priori_, no rational guarantee of their necessary suitableness to
represent the mathematical law of every other class of phenomena. I will
explain presently the general artifice, so profoundly ingenious, by
which the human mind has succeeded in diminishing, in a remarkable
degree, this fundamental difficulty which is presented by the relation
of the concrete to the abstract in mathematics, without, however, its
having been necessary to multiply the number of these analytical
elements.




THE TWO PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS OF THE CALCULUS.


The preceding explanations determine with precision the true object and
the real field of abstract mathematics. I must now pass to the
examination of its principal divisions, for thus far we have considered
the calculus as a whole.

The first direct consideration to be presented on the composition of the
science of the _calculus_ consists in dividing it, in the first place,
into two principal branches, to which, for want of more suitable
denominations, I will give the names of _Algebraic calculus_, or
_Algebra_, and of _Arithmetical calculus_, or _Arithmetic_; but with
the caution to take these two expressions in their most extended logical
acceptation, in the place of the by far too restricted meaning which is
usually attached to them.

The complete solution of every question of the _calculus_, from the most
elementary up to the most transcendental, is necessarily composed of two
successive parts, whose nature is essentially distinct. In the first,
the object is to transform the proposed equations, so as to make
apparent the manner in which the unknown quantities are formed by the
known ones: it is this which constitutes the _algebraic_ question. In
the second, our object is to _find the values_ of the formulas thus
obtained; that is, to determine directly the values of the numbers
sought, which are already represented by certain explicit functions of
given numbers: this is the _arithmetical_ question.[4] It is apparent
that, in every solution which is truly rational, it necessarily follows
the algebraical question, of which it forms the indispensable
complement, since it is evidently necessary to know the mode of
generation of the numbers sought for before determining their actual
values for each particular case. Thus the stopping-place of the
algebraic part of the solution becomes the starting point of the
arithmetical part.

  [Footnote 4: Suppose, for example, that a question gives the
  following equation between an unknown magnitude x, and two known
  magnitudes, _a_ and _b_,

  _x³_ + 3_ax_ = 2_b_,

  as is the case in the problem of the trisection of an angle. We see
  at once that the dependence between _x_ on the one side, and _ab_ on
  the other, is completely determined; but, so long as the equation
  preserves its primitive form, we do not at all perceive in what
  manner the unknown quantity is derived from the data. This must be
  discovered, however, before we can think of determining its value.
  Such is the object of the algebraic part of the solution. When, by a
  series of transformations which have successively rendered that
  derivation more and more apparent, we have arrived at presenting the
  proposed equation under the form

  _x_ = ∛(_b_ + √(_b²_ + _a³_)) + ∛(_b_ - √(_b²_ + _a³_)),

  the work of _algebra_ is finished; and even if we could not perform
  the arithmetical operations indicated by that formula, we would
  nevertheless have obtained a knowledge very real, and often very
  important. The work of _arithmetic_ will now consist in taking that
  formula for its starting point, and finding the number _x_ when the
  values of the numbers _a_ and _b_ are given.]

We thus see that the _algebraic_ calculus and the _arithmetical_
calculus differ essentially in their object. They differ no less in the
point of view under which they regard quantities; which are considered
in the first as to their _relations_, and in the second as to their
_values_. The true spirit of the calculus, in general, requires this
distinction to be maintained with the most severe exactitude, and the
line of demarcation between the two periods of the solution to be
rendered as clear and distinct as the proposed question permits. The
attentive observation of this precept, which is too much neglected, may
be of much assistance, in each particular question, in directing the
efforts of our mind, at any moment of the solution, towards the real
corresponding difficulty. In truth, the imperfection of the science of
the calculus obliges us very often (as will be explained in the next
chapter) to intermingle algebraic and arithmetical considerations in the
solution of the same question. But, however impossible it may be to
separate clearly the two parts of the labour, yet the preceding
indications will always enable us to avoid confounding them.

In endeavouring to sum up as succinctly as possible the distinction just
established, we see that ALGEBRA may be defined, in general, as having
for its object the _resolution of equations_; taking this expression in
its full logical meaning, which signifies the transformation of
_implicit_ functions into equivalent _explicit_ ones. In the same way,
ARITHMETIC may be defined as destined to _the determination of the
values of functions_. Henceforth, therefore, we will briefly say that
ALGEBRA is the _Calculus of Functions_, and ARITHMETIC the _Calculus of
Values_.

We can now perceive how insufficient and even erroneous are the ordinary
definitions. Most generally, the exaggerated importance attributed to
Signs has led to the distinguishing the two fundamental branches of the
science of the Calculus by the manner of designating in each the
subjects of discussion, an idea which is evidently absurd in principle
and false in fact. Even the celebrated definition given by Newton,
characterizing _Algebra_ as _Universal Arithmetic_, gives certainly a
very false idea of the nature of algebra and of that of arithmetic.[5]

  [Footnote 5: I have thought that I ought to specially notice this
  definition, because it serves as the basis of the opinion which
  many intelligent persons, unacquainted with mathematical science,
  form of its abstract part, without considering that at the time of
  this definition mathematical analysis was not sufficiently
  developed to enable the general character of each of its principal
  parts to be properly apprehended, which explains why Newton could
  at that time propose a definition which at the present day he would
  certainly reject.]

Having thus established the fundamental division of the calculus into
two principal branches, I have now to compare in general terms the
extent, the importance, and the difficulty of these two sorts of
calculus, so as to have hereafter to consider only the _Calculus of
Functions_, which is to be the principal subject of our study.




THE CALCULUS OF VALUES, OR ARITHMETIC.


_Its Extent._ The _Calculus of Values, or Arithmetic_, would appear, at
first view, to present a field as vast as that of _algebra_, since it
would seem to admit as many distinct questions as we can conceive
different algebraic formulas whose values are to be determined. But a
very simple reflection will show the difference. Dividing functions into
_simple_ and _compound_, it is evident that when we know how to
determine the _value_ of simple functions, the consideration of compound
functions will no longer present any difficulty. In the algebraic point
of view, a compound function plays a very different part from that of
the elementary functions of which it consists, and from this, indeed,
proceed all the principal difficulties of analysis. But it is very
different with the Arithmetical Calculus. Thus the number of truly
distinct arithmetical operations is only that determined by the number
of the elementary abstract functions, the very limited list of which has
been given above. The determination of the values of these ten functions
necessarily gives that of all the functions, infinite in number, which
are considered in the whole of mathematical analysis, such at least as
it exists at present. There can be no new arithmetical operations
without the creation of really new analytical elements, the number of
which must always be extremely small. The field of _arithmetic_ is,
then, by its nature, exceedingly restricted, while that of algebra is
rigorously indefinite.

It is, however, important to remark, that the domain of the _calculus of
values_ is, in reality, much more extensive than it is commonly
represented; for several questions truly _arithmetical_, since they
consist of determinations of values, are not ordinarily classed as such,
because we are accustomed to treat them only as incidental in the midst
of a body of analytical researches more or less elevated, the too high
opinion commonly formed of the influence of signs being again the
principal cause of this confusion of ideas. Thus not only the
construction of a table of logarithms, but also the calculation of
trigonometrical tables, are true arithmetical operations of a higher
kind. We may also cite as being in the same class, although in a very
distinct and more elevated order, all the methods by which we determine
directly the value of any function for each particular system of values
attributed to the quantities on which it depends, when we cannot express
in general terms the explicit form of that function. In this point of
view the _numerical_ solution of questions which we cannot resolve
algebraically, and even the calculation of "Definite Integrals," whose
general integrals we do not know, really make a part, in spite of all
appearances, of the domain of _arithmetic_, in which we must necessarily
comprise all that which has for its object the _determination of the
values of functions_. The considerations relative to this object are, in
fact, constantly homogeneous, whatever the _determinations_ in question,
and are always very distinct from truly _algebraic_ considerations.

To complete a just idea of the real extent of the calculus of values, we
must include in it likewise that part of the general science of the
calculus which now bears the name of the _Theory of Numbers_, and which
is yet so little advanced. This branch, very extensive by its nature,
but whose importance in the general system of science is not very
great, has for its object the discovery of the properties inherent in
different numbers by virtue of their values, and independent of any
particular system of numeration. It forms, then, a sort of
_transcendental arithmetic_; and to it would really apply the definition
proposed by Newton for algebra.

The entire domain of arithmetic is, then, much more extended than is
commonly supposed; but this _calculus of values_ will still never be
more than a point, so to speak, in comparison with the _calculus of
functions_, of which mathematical science essentially consists. This
comparative estimate will be still more apparent from some
considerations which I have now to indicate respecting the true nature
of arithmetical questions in general, when they are more profoundly
examined.


_Its true Nature._ In seeking to determine with precision in what
_determinations of values_ properly consist, we easily recognize that
they are nothing else but veritable _transformations_ of the functions
to be valued; transformations which, in spite of their special end, are
none the less essentially of the same nature as all those taught by
analysis. In this point of view, the _calculus of values_ might be
simply conceived as an appendix, and a particular application of the
_calculus of functions_, so that _arithmetic_ would disappear, so to
say, as a distinct section in the whole body of abstract mathematics.

In order thoroughly to comprehend this consideration, we must observe
that, when we propose to determine the _value_ of an unknown number
whose mode of formation is given, it is, by the mere enunciation of the
arithmetical question, already defined and expressed under a certain
form; and that in _determining its value_ we only put its expression
under another determinate form, to which we are accustomed to refer the
exact notion of each particular number by making it re-enter into the
regular system of _numeration_. The determination of values consists so
completely of a simple _transformation_, that when the primitive
expression of the number is found to be already conformed to the regular
system of numeration, there is no longer any determination of value,
properly speaking, or, rather, the question is answered by the question
itself. Let the question be to add the two numbers _one_ and _twenty_,
we answer it by merely repeating the enunciation of the question,[6] and
nevertheless we think that we have _determined the value_ of the sum.
This signifies that in this case the first expression of the function
had no need of being transformed, while it would not be thus in adding
twenty-three and fourteen, for then the sum would not be immediately
expressed in a manner conformed to the rank which it occupies in the
fixed and general scale of numeration.


  [Footnote 6: This is less strictly true in the English system of
  numeration than in the French, since "twenty-one" is our more usual
  mode of expressing this number.]

To sum up as comprehensively as possible the preceding views, we may
say, that to determine the _value_ of a number is nothing else than
putting its primitive expression under the form

  _a_ + _bz_ + _cz²_ + _dz³_ + _ez⁴_ . . . . . + _pz^m_,

_z_ being generally equal to 10, and the coefficients _a_, _b_, _c_,
_d_, &c., being subjected to the conditions of being whole numbers less
than _z_; capable of becoming equal to zero; but never negative. Every
arithmetical question may thus be stated as consisting in putting under
such a form any abstract function whatever of different quantities,
which are supposed to have themselves a similar form already. We might
then see in the different operations of arithmetic only simple
particular cases of certain algebraic transformations, excepting the
special difficulties belonging to conditions relating to the nature of
the coefficients.

It clearly follows that abstract mathematics is essentially composed of
the _Calculus of Functions_, which had been already seen to be its most
important, most extended, and most difficult part. It will henceforth be
the exclusive subject of our analytical investigations. I will therefore
no longer delay on the _Calculus of Values_, but pass immediately to the
examination of the fundamental division of the _Calculus of Functions_.




THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS, OR ALGEBRA.


_Principle of its Fundamental Division._ We have determined, at the
beginning of this chapter, wherein properly consists the difficulty
which we experience in putting mathematical questions into _equations_.
It is essentially because of the insufficiency of the very small number
of analytical elements which we possess, that the relation of the
concrete to the abstract is usually so difficult to establish. Let us
endeavour now to appreciate in a philosophical manner the general
process by which the human mind has succeeded, in so great a number of
important cases, in overcoming this fundamental obstacle to _The
establishment of Equations_.


1. _By the Creation of new Functions._ In looking at this important
question from the most general point of view, we are led at once to the
conception of one means of facilitating the establishment of the
equations of phenomena. Since the principal obstacle in this matter
comes from the too small number of our analytical elements, the whole
question would seem to be reduced to creating new ones. But this means,
though natural, is really illusory; and though it might be useful, it is
certainly insufficient.

In fact, the creation of an elementary abstract function, which shall be
veritably new, presents in itself the greatest difficulties. There is
even something contradictory in such an idea; for a new analytical
element would evidently not fulfil its essential and appropriate
conditions, if we could not immediately _determine its value_. Now, on
the other hand, how are we to _determine the value_ of a new function
which is truly _simple_, that is, which is not formed by a combination
of those already known? That appears almost impossible. The introduction
into analysis of another elementary abstract function, or rather of
another couple of functions (for each would be always accompanied by its
_inverse_), supposes then, of necessity, the simultaneous creation of a
new arithmetical operation, which is certainly very difficult.

If we endeavour to obtain an idea of the means which the human mind
employs for inventing new analytical elements, by the examination of the
procedures by the aid of which it has actually conceived those which we
already possess, our observations leave us in that respect in an entire
uncertainty, for the artifices which it has already made use of for that
purpose are evidently exhausted. To convince ourselves of it, let us
consider the last couple of simple functions which has been introduced
into analysis, and at the formation of which we have been present, so
to speak, namely, the fourth couple; for, as I have explained, the fifth
couple does not strictly give veritable new analytical elements. The
function _a^x_, and, consequently, its inverse, have been formed by
conceiving, under a new point of view, a function which had been a long
time known, namely, powers--when the idea of them had become
sufficiently generalized. The consideration of a power relatively to the
variation of its exponent, instead of to the variation of its base, was
sufficient to give rise to a truly novel simple function, the variation
following then an entirely different route. But this artifice, as simple
as ingenious, can furnish nothing more; for, in turning over in the same
manner all our present analytical elements, we end in only making them
return into one another.

We have, then, no idea as to how we could proceed to the creation of new
elementary abstract functions which would properly satisfy all the
necessary conditions. This is not to say, however, that we have at
present attained the effectual limit established in that respect by the
bounds of our intelligence. It is even certain that the last special
improvements in mathematical analysis have contributed to extend our
resources in that respect, by introducing within the domain of the
calculus certain definite integrals, which in some respects supply the
place of new simple functions, although they are far from fulfilling all
the necessary conditions, which has prevented me from inserting them in
the table of true analytical elements. But, on the whole, I think it
unquestionable that the number of these elements cannot increase except
with extreme slowness. It is therefore not from these sources that the
human mind has drawn its most powerful means of facilitating, as much
as is possible, the establishment of equations.


2. _By the Conception of Equations between certain auxiliary
Quantities._ This first method being set aside, there remains evidently
but one other: it is, seeing the impossibility of finding directly the
equations between the quantities under consideration, to seek for
corresponding ones between other auxiliary quantities, connected with
the first according to a certain determinate law, and from the relation
between which we may return to that between the primitive magnitudes.
Such is, in substance, the eminently fruitful conception, which the
human mind has succeeded in establishing, and which constitutes its most
admirable instrument for the mathematical explanation of natural
phenomena; the _analysis_, called _transcendental_.

As a general philosophical principle, the auxiliary quantities, which
are introduced in the place of the primitive magnitudes, or concurrently
with them, in order to facilitate the establishment of equations, might
be derived according to any law whatever from the immediate elements of
the question. This conception has thus a much more extensive reach than
has been commonly attributed to it by even the most profound geometers.
It is extremely important for us to view it in its whole logical extent,
for it will perhaps be by establishing a general mode of _derivation_
different from that to which we have thus far confined ourselves
(although it is evidently very far from being the only possible one)
that we shall one day succeed in essentially perfecting mathematical
analysis as a whole, and consequently in establishing more powerful
means of investigating the laws of nature than our present processes,
which are unquestionably susceptible of becoming exhausted.

But, regarding merely the present constitution of the science, the only
auxiliary quantities habitually introduced in the place of the primitive
quantities in the _Transcendental Analysis_ are what are called, 1⁰,
_infinitely small_ elements, the _differentials_ (of different orders)
of those quantities, if we regard this analysis in the manner of
LEIBNITZ; or, 2⁰, the _fluxions_, the limits of the ratios of the
simultaneous increments of the primitive quantities compared with one
another, or, more briefly, the _prime and ultimate ratios_ of these
increments, if we adopt the conception of NEWTON; or, 3⁰, the
_derivatives_, properly so called, of those quantities, that is, the
coefficients of the different terms of their respective increments,
according to the conception of LAGRANGE.

These three principal methods of viewing our present transcendental
analysis, and all the other less distinctly characterized ones which
have been successively proposed, are, by their nature, necessarily
identical, whether in the calculation or in the application, as will be
explained in a general manner in the third chapter. As to their relative
value, we shall there see that the conception of Leibnitz has thus far,
in practice, an incontestable superiority, but that its logical
character is exceedingly vicious; while that the conception of Lagrange,
admirable by its simplicity, by its logical perfection, by the
philosophical unity which it has established in mathematical analysis
(till then separated into two almost entirely independent worlds),
presents, as yet, serious inconveniences in the applications, by
retarding the progress of the mind. The conception of Newton occupies
nearly middle ground in these various relations, being less rapid, but
more rational than that of Leibnitz; less philosophical, but more
applicable than that of Lagrange.

This is not the place to explain the advantages of the introduction of
this kind of auxiliary quantities in the place of the primitive
magnitudes. The third chapter is devoted to this subject. At present I
limit myself to consider this conception in the most general manner, in
order to deduce therefrom the fundamental division of the _calculus of
functions_ into two systems essentially distinct, whose dependence, for
the complete solution of any one mathematical question, is invariably
determinate.

In this connexion, and in the logical order of ideas, the transcendental
analysis presents itself as being necessarily the first, since its
general object is to facilitate the establishment of equations, an
operation which must evidently precede the _resolution_ of those
equations, which is the object of the ordinary analysis. But though it
is exceedingly important to conceive in this way the true relations of
these two systems of analysis, it is none the less proper, in conformity
with the regular usage, to study the transcendental analysis after
ordinary analysis; for though the former is, at bottom, by itself
logically independent of the latter, or, at least, may be essentially
disengaged from it, yet it is clear that, since its employment in the
solution of questions has always more or less need of being completed by
the use of the ordinary analysis, we would be constrained to leave the
questions in suspense if this latter had not been previously studied.


_Corresponding Divisions of the Calculus of Functions._ It follows from
the preceding considerations that the _Calculus of Functions_, or
_Algebra_ (taking this word in its most extended meaning), is composed
of two distinct fundamental branches, one of which has for its immediate
object the _resolution_ of equations, when they are directly established
between the magnitudes themselves which are under consideration; and the
other, starting from equations (generally much easier to form) between
quantities indirectly connected with those of the problem, has for its
peculiar and constant destination the deduction, by invariable
analytical methods, of the corresponding equations between the direct
magnitudes which we are considering; which brings the question within
the domain of the preceding calculus.

The former calculus bears most frequently the name of _Ordinary
Analysis_, or of _Algebra_, properly so called. The second constitutes
what is called the _Transcendental Analysis_, which has been designated
by the different denominations of _Infinitesimal Calculus_, _Calculus of
Fluxions and of Fluents_, _Calculus of Vanishing Quantities_, the
_Differential and Integral Calculus_, &c., according to the point of
view in which it has been conceived.

In order to remove every foreign consideration, I will propose to name
it CALCULUS OF INDIRECT FUNCTIONS, giving to ordinary analysis the title
of CALCULUS OF DIRECT FUNCTIONS. These expressions, which I form
essentially by generalizing and epitomizing the ideas of Lagrange, are
simply intended to indicate with precision the true general character
belonging to each of these two forms of analysis.

Having now established the fundamental division of mathematical
analysis, I have next to consider separately each of its two parts,
commencing with the _Calculus of Direct Functions_, and reserving more
extended developments for the different branches of the _Calculus of
Indirect Functions_.




CHAPTER II.

ORDINARY ANALYSIS, OR ALGEBRA.


The _Calculus of direct Functions_, or _Algebra_, is (as was shown at
the end of the preceding chapter) entirely sufficient for the solution
of mathematical questions, when they are so simple that we can form
directly the equations between the magnitudes themselves which we are
considering, without its being necessary to introduce in their place, or
conjointly with them, any system of auxiliary quantities _derived_ from
the first. It is true that in the greatest number of important cases its
use requires to be preceded and prepared by that of the _Calculus of
indirect Functions_, which is intended to facilitate the establishment
of equations. But, although algebra has then only a secondary office to
perform, it has none the less a necessary part in the complete solution
of the question, so that the _Calculus of direct Functions_ must
continue to be, by its nature, the fundamental base of all mathematical
analysis. We must therefore, before going any further, consider in a
general manner the logical composition of this calculus, and the degree
of development to which it has at the present day arrived.


_Its Object._ The final object of this calculus being the _resolution_
(properly so called) of _equations_, that is, the discovery of the
manner in which the unknown quantities are formed from the known
quantities, in accordance with the _equations_ which exist between them,
it naturally presents as many different departments as we can conceive
truly distinct classes of equations. Its appropriate extent is
consequently rigorously indefinite, the number of analytical functions
susceptible of entering into equations being in itself quite unlimited,
although they are composed of only a very small number of primitive
elements.


_Classification of Equations._ The rational classification of equations
must evidently be determined by the nature of the analytical elements of
which their numbers are composed; every other classification would be
essentially arbitrary. Accordingly, analysts begin by dividing equations
with one or more variables into two principal classes, according as they
contain functions of only the first three couples (see the table in
chapter i., page 51), or as they include also exponential or circular
functions. The names of _Algebraic_ functions and _Transcendental_
functions, commonly given to these two principal groups of analytical
elements, are undoubtedly very inappropriate. But the universally
established division between the corresponding equations is none the
less very real in this sense, that the resolution of equations
containing the functions called _transcendental_ necessarily presents
more difficulties than those of the equations called _algebraic_. Hence
the study of the former is as yet exceedingly imperfect, so that
frequently the resolution of the most simple of them is still unknown to
us,[7] and our analytical methods have almost exclusive reference to the
elaboration of the latter.

  [Footnote 7: Simple as may seem, for example, the equation

  _a^x_ + _b^x_ = _c^x_,

  we do not yet know how to resolve it, which may give some idea of
  the extreme imperfection of this part of algebra.]




ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS.


Considering now only these _Algebraic_ equations, we must observe, in
the first place, that although they may often contain _irrational_
functions of the unknown quantities as well as _rational_ functions, we
can always, by more or less easy transformations, make the first case
come under the second, so that it is with this last that analysts have
had to occupy themselves exclusively in order to resolve all sorts of
_algebraic_ equations.


_Their Classification._ In the infancy of algebra, these equations were
classed according to the number of their terms. But this classification
was evidently faulty, since it separated cases which were really
similar, and brought together others which had nothing in common besides
this unimportant characteristic.[8] It has been retained only for
equations with two terms, which are, in fact, capable of being resolved
in a manner peculiar to themselves.

  [Footnote 8: The same error was afterward committed, in the infancy
  of the infinitesimal calculus, in relation to the integration of
  differential equations.]

The classification of equations by what is called their _degrees_, is,
on the other hand, eminently natural, for this distinction rigorously
determines the greater or less difficulty of their _resolution_. This
gradation is apparent in the cases of all the equations which can be
resolved; but it may be indicated in a general manner independently of
the fact of the resolution. We need only consider that the most general
equation of each degree necessarily comprehends all those of the
different inferior degrees, as must also the formula which determines
the unknown quantity. Consequently, however slight we may suppose the
difficulty peculiar to the _degree_ which we are considering, since it
is inevitably complicated in the execution with those presented by all
the preceding degrees, the resolution really offers more and more
obstacles, in proportion as the degree of the equation is elevated.




ALGEBRAIC RESOLUTION OF EQUATIONS.


_Its Limits._ The resolution of algebraic equations is as yet known to
us only in the four first degrees, such is the increase of difficulty
noticed above. In this respect, algebra has made no considerable
progress since the labours of Descartes and the Italian analysts of the
sixteenth century, although in the last two centuries there has been
perhaps scarcely a single geometer who has not busied himself in trying
to advance the resolution of equations. The general equation of the
fifth degree itself has thus far resisted all attacks.

The constantly increasing complication which the formulas for resolving
equations must necessarily present, in proportion as the degree
increases (the difficulty of using the formula of the fourth degree
rendering it almost inapplicable), has determined analysts to renounce,
by a tacit agreement, the pursuit of such researches, although they are
far from regarding it as impossible to obtain the resolution of
equations of the fifth degree, and of several other higher ones.


_General Solution._ The only question of this kind which would be really
of great importance, at least in its logical relations, would be the
general resolution of algebraic equations of any degree whatsoever. Now,
the more we meditate on this subject, the more we are led to think, with
Lagrange, that it really surpasses the scope of our intelligence. We
must besides observe that the formula which would express the _root_ of
an equation of the _m^{th}_ degree would necessarily include radicals of
the _m^{th}_ order (or functions of an equivalent multiplicity), because
of the _m_ determinations which it must admit. Since we have seen,
besides, that this formula must also embrace, as a particular case, that
formula which corresponds to every lower degree, it follows that it
would inevitably also contain radicals of the next lower degree, the
next lower to that, &c., so that, even if it were possible to discover
it, it would almost always present too great a complication to be
capable of being usefully employed, unless we could succeed in
simplifying it, at the same time retaining all its generality, by the
introduction of a new class of analytical elements of which we yet have
no idea. We have, then, reason to believe that, without having already
here arrived at the limits imposed by the feeble extent of our
intelligence, we should not be long in reaching them if we actively and
earnestly prolonged this series of investigations.

It is, besides, important to observe that, even supposing we had
obtained the resolution of _algebraic_ equations of any degree whatever,
we would still have treated only a very small part of _algebra_,
properly so called, that is, of the calculus of direct functions,
including the resolution of all the equations which can be formed by the
known analytical functions.

Finally, we must remember that, by an undeniable law of human nature,
our means for conceiving new questions being much more powerful than our
resources for resolving them, or, in other words, the human mind being
much more ready to inquire than to reason, we shall necessarily always
remain _below_ the difficulty, no matter to what degree of development
our intellectual labour may arrive. Thus, even though we should some day
discover the complete resolution of all the analytical equations at
present known, chimerical as the supposition is, there can be no doubt
that, before attaining this end, and probably even as a subsidiary
means, we would have already overcome the difficulty (a much smaller
one, though still very great) of conceiving new analytical elements, the
introduction of which would give rise to classes of equations of which,
at present, we are completely ignorant; so that a similar imperfection
in algebraic science would be continually reproduced, in spite of the
real and very important increase of the absolute mass of our knowledge.


_What we know in Algebra._ In the present condition of algebra, the
complete resolution of the equations of the first four degrees, of any
binomial equations, of certain particular equations of the higher
degrees, and of a very small number of exponential, logarithmic, or
circular equations, constitute the fundamental methods which are
presented by the calculus of direct functions for the solution of
mathematical problems. But, limited as these elements are, geometers
have nevertheless succeeded in treating, in a truly admirable manner, a
very great number of important questions, as we shall find in the course
of the volume. The general improvements introduced within a century into
the total system of mathematical analysis, have had for their principal
object to make immeasurably useful this little knowledge which we have,
instead of tending to increase it. This result has been so fully
obtained, that most frequently this calculus has no real share in the
complete solution of the question, except by its most simple parts;
those which have reference to equations of the two first degrees, with
one or more variables.




NUMERICAL RESOLUTION OF EQUATIONS.


The extreme imperfection of algebra, with respect to the resolution of
equations, has led analysts to occupy themselves with a new class of
questions, whose true character should be here noted. They have busied
themselves in filling up the immense gap in the resolution of algebraic
equations of the higher degrees, by what they have named the _numerical
resolution_ of equations. Not being able to obtain, in general, the
_formula_ which expresses what explicit function of the given quantities
the unknown one is, they have sought (in the absence of this kind of
resolution, the only one really _algebraic_) to determine, independently
of that formula, at least the _value_ of each unknown quantity, for
various designated systems of particular values attributed to the given
quantities. By the successive labours of analysts, this incomplete and
illegitimate operation, which presents an intimate mixture of truly
algebraic questions with others which are purely arithmetical, has been
rendered possible in all cases for equations of any degree and even of
any form. The methods for this which we now possess are sufficiently
general, although the calculations to which they lead are often so
complicated as to render it almost impossible to execute them. We have
nothing else to do, then, in this part of algebra, but to simplify the
methods sufficiently to render them regularly applicable, which we may
hope hereafter to effect. In this condition of the calculus of direct
functions, we endeavour, in its application, so to dispose the proposed
questions as finally to require only this numerical resolution of the
equations.


_Its limited Usefulness._ Valuable as is such a resource in the absence
of the veritable solution, it is essential not to misconceive the true
character of these methods, which analysts rightly regard as a very
imperfect algebra. In fact, we are far from being always able to reduce
our mathematical questions to depend finally upon only the _numerical_
resolution of equations; that can be done only for questions quite
isolated or truly final, that is, for the smallest number. Most
questions, in fact, are only preparatory, and intended to serve as an
indispensable preparation for the solution of other questions. Now, for
such an object, it is evident that it is not the actual _value_ of the
unknown quantity which it is important to discover, but the _formula_,
which shows how it is derived from the other quantities under
consideration. It is this which happens, for example, in a very
extensive class of cases, whenever a certain question includes at the
same time several unknown quantities. We have then, first of all, to
separate them. By suitably employing the simple and general method so
happily invented by analysts, and which consists in referring all the
other unknown quantities to one of them, the difficulty would always
disappear if we knew how to obtain the algebraic resolution of the
equations under consideration, while the _numerical_ solution would then
be perfectly useless. It is only for want of knowing the _algebraic_
resolution of equations with a single unknown quantity, that we are
obliged to treat _Elimination_ as a distinct question, which forms one
of the greatest special difficulties of common algebra. Laborious as are
the methods by the aid of which we overcome this difficulty, they are
not even applicable, in an entirely general manner, to the elimination
of one unknown quantity between two equations of any form whatever.

In the most simple questions, and when we have really to resolve only a
single equation with a single unknown quantity, this _numerical_
resolution is none the less a very imperfect method, even when it is
strictly sufficient. It presents, in fact, this serious inconvenience of
obliging us to repeat the whole series of operations for the slightest
change which may take place in a single one of the quantities
considered, although their relations to one another remain unchanged;
the calculations made for one case not enabling us to dispense with any
of those which relate to a case very slightly different. This happens
because of our inability to abstract and treat separately that purely
algebraic part of the question which is common to all the cases which
result from the mere variation of the given numbers.

According to the preceding considerations, the calculus of direct
functions, viewed in its present state, divides into two very distinct
branches, according as its subject is the _algebraic_ resolution of
equations or their _numerical_ resolution. The first department, the
only one truly satisfactory, is unhappily very limited, and will
probably always remain so; the second, too often insufficient, has, at
least, the advantage of a much greater generality. The necessity of
clearly distinguishing these two parts is evident, because of the
essentially different object proposed in each, and consequently the
peculiar point of view under which quantities are therein considered.


_Different Divisions of the two Methods of Resolution._ If, moreover, we
consider these parts with reference to the different methods of which
each is composed, we find in their logical distribution an entirely
different arrangement. In fact, the first part must be divided according
to the nature of the equations which we are able to resolve, and
independently of every consideration relative to the _values_ of the
unknown quantities. In the second part, on the contrary, it is not
according to the _degrees_ of the equations that the methods are
naturally distinguished, since they are applicable to equations of any
degree whatever; it is according to the numerical character of the
_values_ of the unknown quantities; for, in calculating these numbers
directly, without deducing them from general formulas, different means
would evidently be employed when the numbers are not susceptible of
having their values determined otherwise than by a series of
approximations, always incomplete, or when they can be obtained with
entire exactness. This distinction of _incommensurable_ and of
_commensurable_ roots, which require quite different principles for
their determination, important as it is in the numerical resolution of
equations, is entirely insignificant in the algebraic resolution, in
which the _rational_ or _irrational_ nature of the numbers which are
obtained is a mere accident of the calculation, which cannot exercise
any influence over the methods employed; it is, in a word, a simple
arithmetical consideration. We may say as much, though in a less degree,
of the division of the commensurable roots themselves into _entire_ and
_fractional_. In fine, the case is the same, in a still greater degree,
with the most general classification of roots, as _real_ and
_imaginary_. All these different considerations, which are preponderant
as to the numerical resolution of equations, and which are of no
importance in their algebraic resolution, render more and more sensible
the essentially distinct nature of these two principal parts of algebra.




THE THEORY OF EQUATIONS.


These two departments, which constitute the immediate object of the
calculus of direct functions, are subordinate to a third one, purely
speculative, from which both of them borrow their most powerful
resources, and which has been very exactly designated by the general
name of _Theory of Equations_, although it as yet relates only to
_Algebraic_ equations. The numerical resolution of equations, because of
its generality, has special need of this rational foundation.

This last and important branch of algebra is naturally divided into two
orders of questions, viz., those which refer to the _composition_ of
equations, and those which concern their _transformation_; these latter
having for their object to modify the roots of an equation without
knowing them, in accordance with any given law, providing that this law
is uniform in relation to all the parts.[9]

  [Footnote 9: The fundamental principle on which reposes the theory
  of equations, and which is so frequently applied in all
  mathematical analysis--the decomposition of algebraic, rational,
  and entire functions, of any degree whatever, into factors of the
  first degree--is never employed except for functions of a single
  variable, without any one having examined if it ought to be
  extended to functions of several variables. The general
  impossibility of such a decomposition is demonstrated by the author
  in detail, but more properly belongs to a special treatise.]




THE METHOD OF INDETERMINATE COEFFICIENTS.


To complete this rapid general enumeration of the different essential
parts of the calculus of direct functions, I must, lastly, mention
expressly one of the most fruitful and important theories of algebra
proper, that relating to the transformation of functions into series by
the aid of what is called the _Method of indeterminate Coefficients_.
This method, so eminently analytical, and which must be regarded as one
of the most remarkable discoveries of Descartes, has undoubtedly lost
some of its importance since the invention and the development of the
infinitesimal calculus, the place of which it might so happily take in
some particular respects. But the increasing extension of the
transcendental analysis, although it has rendered this method much less
necessary, has, on the other hand, multiplied its applications and
enlarged its resources; so that by the useful combination between the
two theories, which has finally been effected, the use of the method of
indeterminate coefficients has become at present much more extensive
than it was even before the formation of the calculus of indirect
functions.

       *       *       *       *       *

Having thus sketched the general outlines of algebra proper, I have now
to offer some considerations on several leading points in the calculus
of direct functions, our ideas of which may be advantageously made more
clear by a philosophical examination.




IMAGINARY QUANTITIES.


The difficulties connected with several peculiar symbols to which
algebraic calculations sometimes lead, and especially to the expressions
called _imaginary_, have been, I think, much exaggerated through purely
metaphysical considerations, which have been forced upon them, in the
place of regarding these abnormal results in their true point of view as
simple analytical facts. Viewing them thus, we readily see that, since
the spirit of mathematical analysis consists in considering magnitudes
in reference to their relations only, and without any regard to their
determinate value, analysts are obliged to admit indifferently every
kind of expression which can be engendered by algebraic combinations.
The interdiction of even one expression because of its apparent
singularity would destroy the generality of their conceptions. The
common embarrassment on this subject seems to me to proceed essentially
from an unconscious confusion between the idea of _function_ and the
idea of _value_, or, what comes to the same thing, between the
_algebraic_ and the _arithmetical_ point of view. A thorough examination
would show mathematical analysis to be much more clear in its nature
than even mathematicians commonly suppose.




NEGATIVE QUANTITIES.


As to negative quantities, which have given rise to so many misplaced
discussions, as irrational as useless, we must distinguish between their
_abstract_ signification and their _concrete_ interpretation, which have
been almost always confounded up to the present day. Under the first
point of view, the theory of negative quantities can be established in a
complete manner by a single algebraical consideration. The necessity of
admitting such expressions is the same as for imaginary quantities, as
above indicated; and their employment as an analytical artifice, to
render the formulas more comprehensive, is a mechanism of calculation
which cannot really give rise to any serious difficulty. We may
therefore regard the abstract theory of negative quantities as leaving
nothing essential to desire; it presents no obstacles but those
inappropriately introduced by sophistical considerations.

It is far from being so, however, with their concrete theory. This
consists essentially in that admirable property of the signs + and-, of
representing analytically the oppositions of directions of which certain
magnitudes are susceptible. This _general theorem_ on the relation of
the concrete to the abstract in mathematics is one of the most beautiful
discoveries which we owe to the genius of Descartes, who obtained it as
a simple result of properly directed philosophical observation. A great
number of geometers have since striven to establish directly its general
demonstration, but thus far their efforts have been illusory. Their vain
metaphysical considerations and heterogeneous minglings of the abstract
and the concrete have so confused the subject, that it becomes necessary
to here distinctly enunciate the general fact. It consists in this: if,
in any equation whatever, expressing the relation of certain quantities
which are susceptible of opposition of directions, one or more of those
quantities come to be reckoned in a direction contrary to that which
belonged to them when the equation was first established, it will not be
necessary to form directly a new equation for this second state of the
phenomena; it will suffice to change, in the first equation, the sign of
each of the quantities which shall have changed its direction; and the
equation, thus modified, will always rigorously coincide with that which
we would have arrived at in recommencing to investigate, for this new
case, the analytical law of the phenomenon. The general theorem consists
in this constant and necessary coincidence. Now, as yet, no one has
succeeded in directly proving this; we have assured ourselves of it only
by a great number of geometrical and mechanical verifications, which
are, it is true, sufficiently multiplied, and especially sufficiently
varied, to prevent any clear mind from having the least doubt of the
exactitude and the generality of this essential property, but which, in
a philosophical point of view, do not at all dispense with the research
for so important an explanation. The extreme extent of the theorem must
make us comprehend both the fundamental difficulties of this research
and the high utility for the perfecting of mathematical science which
would belong to the general conception of this great truth. This
imperfection of theory, however, has not prevented geometers from making
the most extensive and the most important use of this property in all
parts of concrete mathematics.

It follows from the above general enunciation of the fact, independently
of any demonstration, that the property of which we speak must never be
applied to magnitudes whose directions are continually varying, without
giving rise to a simple opposition of direction; in that case, the sign
with which every result of calculation is necessarily affected is not
susceptible of any concrete interpretation, and the attempts sometimes
made to establish one are erroneous. This circumstance occurs, among
other occasions, in the case of a radius vector in geometry, and
diverging forces in mechanics.




PRINCIPLE OF HOMOGENEITY.


A second general theorem on the relation of the concrete to the abstract
is that which is ordinarily designated under the name of _Principle of
Homogeneity_. It is undoubtedly much less important in its applications
than the preceding, but it particularly merits our attention as having,
by its nature, a still greater extent, since it is applicable to all
phenomena without distinction, and because of the real utility which it
often possesses for the verification of their analytical laws. I can,
moreover, exhibit a direct and general demonstration of it which seems
to me very simple. It is founded on this single observation, which is
self-evident, that the exactitude of every relation between any concrete
magnitudes whatsoever is independent of the value of the _units_ to
which they are referred for the purpose of expressing them in numbers.
For example, the relation which exists between the three sides of a
right-angled triangle is the same, whether they are measured by yards,
or by miles, or by inches.

It follows from this general consideration, that every equation which
expresses the analytical law of any phenomenon must possess this
property of being in no way altered, when all the quantities which are
found in it are made to undergo simultaneously the change corresponding
to that which their respective units would experience. Now this change
evidently consists in all the quantities of each sort becoming at once
_m_ times smaller, if the unit which corresponds to them becomes _m_
times greater, or reciprocally. Thus every equation which represents any
concrete relation whatever must possess this characteristic of remaining
the same, when we make _m_ times greater all the quantities which it
contains, and which express the magnitudes between which the relation
exists; excepting always the numbers which designate simply the mutual
_ratios_ of these different magnitudes, and which therefore remain
invariable during the change of the units. It is this property which
constitutes the law of Homogeneity in its most extended signification,
that is, of whatever analytical functions the equations may be composed.

But most frequently we consider only the cases in which the functions
are such as are called _algebraic_, and to which the idea of _degree_ is
applicable. In this case we can give more precision to the general
proposition by determining the analytical character which must be
necessarily presented by the equation, in order that this property may
be verified. It is easy to see, then, that, by the modification just
explained, all the _terms_ of the first degree, whatever may be their
form, rational or irrational, entire or fractional, will become _m_
times greater; all those of the second degree, _m²_ times; those of the
third, _m³_ times, &c. Thus the terms of the same degree, however
different may be their composition, varying in the same manner, and the
terms of different degrees varying in an unequal proportion, whatever
similarity there may be in their composition, it will be necessary, to
prevent the equation from being disturbed, that all the terms which it
contains should be of the same degree. It is in this that properly
consists the ordinary theorem of _Homogeneity_, and it is from this
circumstance that the general law has derived its name, which, however,
ceases to be exactly proper for all other functions.

In order to treat this subject in its whole extent, it is important to
observe an essential condition, to which attention must be paid in
applying this property when the phenomenon expressed by the equation
presents magnitudes of different natures. Thus it may happen that the
respective units are completely independent of each other, and then the
theorem of Homogeneity will hold good, either with reference to all the
corresponding classes of quantities, or with regard to only a single one
or more of them. But it will happen on other occasions that the
different units will have fixed relations to one another, determined by
the nature of the question; then it will be necessary to pay attention
to this subordination of the units in verifying the homogeneity, which
will not exist any longer in a purely algebraic sense, and the precise
form of which will vary according to the nature of the phenomena. Thus,
for example, to fix our ideas, when, in the analytical expression of
geometrical phenomena, we are considering at once lines, areas, and
volumes, it will be necessary to observe that the three corresponding
units are necessarily so connected with each other that, according to
the subordination generally established in that respect, when the first
becomes _m_ times greater, the second becomes _m²_ times, and the third
_m³_ times. It is with such a modification that homogeneity will exist
in the equations, in which, if they are _algebraic_, we will have to
estimate the degree of each term by doubling the exponents of the
factors which correspond to areas, and tripling those of the factors
relating to volumes.

       *       *       *       *       *

Such are the principal general considerations relating to the _Calculus
of Direct Functions_. We have now to pass to the philosophical
examination of the _Calculus of Indirect Functions_, the much superior
importance and extent of which claim a fuller development.




CHAPTER III.

TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYSIS:

DIFFERENT MODES OF VIEWING IT.


We determined, in the second chapter, the philosophical character of the
transcendental analysis, in whatever manner it may be conceived,
considering only the general nature of its actual destination as a part
of mathematical science. This analysis has been presented by geometers
under several points of view, really distinct, although necessarily
equivalent, and leading always to identical results. They may be reduced
to three principal ones; those of LEIBNITZ, of NEWTON, and of LAGRANGE,
of which all the others are only secondary modifications. In the present
state of science, each of these three general conceptions offers
essential advantages which pertain to it exclusively, without our having
yet succeeded in constructing a single method uniting all these
different characteristic qualities. This combination will probably be
hereafter effected by some method founded upon the conception of
Lagrange when that important philosophical labour shall have been
accomplished, the study of the other conceptions will have only a
historic interest; but, until then, the science must be considered as in
only a provisional state, which requires the simultaneous consideration
of all the various modes of viewing this calculus. Illogical as may
appear this multiplicity of conceptions of one identical subject, still,
without them all, we could form but a very insufficient idea of this
analysis, whether in itself, or more especially in relation to its
applications. This want of system in the most important part of
mathematical analysis will not appear strange if we consider, on the one
hand, its great extent and its superior difficulty, and, on the other,
its recent formation.




ITS EARLY HISTORY.


If we had to trace here the systematic history of the successive
formation of the transcendental analysis, it would be necessary
previously to distinguish carefully from the _calculus of indirect
functions_, properly so called, the original idea of the _infinitesimal
method_, which can be conceived by itself, independently of any
_calculus_. We should see that the first germ of this idea is found in
the procedure constantly employed by the Greek geometers, under the name
of the _Method of Exhaustions_, as a means of passing from the
properties of straight lines to those of curves, and consisting
essentially in substituting for the curve the auxiliary consideration of
an inscribed or circumscribed polygon, by means of which they rose to
the curve itself, taking in a suitable manner the limits of the
primitive ratios. Incontestable as is this filiation of ideas, it would
be giving it a greatly exaggerated importance to see in this method of
exhaustions the real equivalent of our modern methods, as some geometers
have done; for the ancients had no logical and general means for the
determination of these limits, and this was commonly the greatest
difficulty of the question; so that their solutions were not subjected
to abstract and invariable rules, the uniform application of which would
lead with certainty to the knowledge sought; which is, on the contrary,
the principal characteristic of our transcendental analysis. In a word,
there still remained the task of generalizing the conceptions used by
the ancients, and, more especially, by considering it in a manner purely
abstract, of reducing it to a complete system of calculation, which to
them was impossible.

The first idea which was produced in this new direction goes back to the
great geometer Fermat, whom Lagrange has justly presented as having
blocked out the direct formation of the transcendental analysis by his
method for the determination of _maxima_ and _minima_, and for the
finding of _tangents_, which consisted essentially in introducing the
auxiliary consideration of the correlative increments of the proposed
variables, increments afterward suppressed as equal to zero when the
equations had undergone certain suitable transformations. But, although
Fermat was the first to conceive this analysis in a truly abstract
manner, it was yet far from being regularly formed into a general and
distinct calculus having its own notation, and especially freed from the
superfluous consideration of terms which, in the analysis of Fermat,
were finally not taken into the account, after having nevertheless
greatly complicated all the operations by their presence. This is what
Leibnitz so happily executed, half a century later, after some
intermediate modifications of the ideas of Fermat introduced by Wallis,
and still more by Barrow; and he has thus been the true creator of the
transcendental analysis, such as we now employ it. This admirable
discovery was so ripe (like all the great conceptions of the human
intellect at the moment of their manifestation), that Newton, on his
side, had arrived, at the same time, or a little earlier, at a method
exactly equivalent, by considering this analysis under a very different
point of view, which, although more logical in itself, is really less
adapted to give to the common fundamental method all the extent and the
facility which have been imparted to it by the ideas of Leibnitz.
Finally, Lagrange, putting aside the heterogeneous considerations which
had guided Leibnitz and Newton, has succeeded in reducing the
transcendental analysis, in its greatest perfection, to a purely
algebraic system, which only wants more aptitude for its practical
applications.

After this summary glance at the general history of the transcendental
analysis, we will proceed to the dogmatic exposition of the three
principal conceptions, in order to appreciate exactly their
characteristic properties, and to show the necessary identity of the
methods which are thence derived. Let us begin with that of Leibnitz.




METHOD OF LEIBNITZ.


_Infinitely small Elements._ This consists in introducing into the
calculus, in order to facilitate the establishment of equations, the
infinitely small elements of which all the quantities, the relations
between which are sought, are considered to be composed. These elements
or _differentials_ will have certain relations to one another, which are
constantly and necessarily more simple and easy to discover than those
of the primitive quantities, and by means of which we will be enabled
(by a special calculus having for its peculiar object the elimination of
these auxiliary infinitesimals) to go back to the desired equations,
which it would have been most frequently impossible to obtain directly.
This indirect analysis may have different degrees of indirectness; for,
when there is too much difficulty in forming immediately the equation
between the differentials of the magnitudes under consideration, a
second application of the same general artifice will have to be made,
and these differentials be treated, in their turn, as new primitive
quantities, and a relation be sought between their infinitely small
elements (which, with reference to the final objects of the question,
will be _second differentials_), and so on; the same transformation
admitting of being repeated any number of times, on the condition of
finally eliminating the constantly increasing number of infinitesimal
quantities introduced as auxiliaries.

A person not yet familiar with these considerations does not perceive at
once how the employment of these auxiliary quantities can facilitate the
discovery of the analytical laws of phenomena; for the infinitely small
increments of the proposed magnitudes being of the same species with
them, it would seem that their relations should not be obtained with
more ease, inasmuch as the greater or less value of a quantity cannot,
in fact, exercise any influence on an inquiry which is necessarily
independent, by its nature, of every idea of value. But it is easy,
nevertheless, to explain very clearly, and in a quite general manner,
how far the question must be simplified by such an artifice. For this
purpose, it is necessary to begin by distinguishing _different orders_
of infinitely small quantities, a very precise idea of which may be
obtained by considering them as being either the successive powers of
the same primitive infinitely small quantity, or as being quantities
which may be regarded as having finite ratios with these powers; so
that, to take an example, the second, third, &c., differentials of any
one variable are classed as infinitely small quantities of the second
order, the third, &c., because it is easy to discover in them finite
multiples of the second, third, &c., powers of a certain first
differential. These preliminary ideas being established, the spirit of
the infinitesimal analysis consists in constantly neglecting the
infinitely small quantities in comparison with finite quantities, and
generally the infinitely small quantities of any order whatever in
comparison with all those of an inferior order. It is at once apparent
how much such a liberty must facilitate the formation of equations
between the differentials of quantities, since, in the place of these
differentials, we can substitute such other elements as we may choose,
and as will be more simple to consider, only taking care to conform to
this single condition, that the new elements differ from the preceding
ones only by quantities infinitely small in comparison with them. It is
thus that it will be possible, in geometry, to treat curved lines as
composed of an infinity of rectilinear elements, curved surfaces as
formed of plane elements, and, in mechanics, variable motions as an
infinite series of uniform motions, succeeding one another at infinitely
small intervals of time.


EXAMPLES. Considering the importance of this admirable conception, I
think that I ought here to complete the illustration of its fundamental
character by the summary indication of some leading examples.


1. _Tangents._ Let it be required to determine, for each point of a
plane curve, the equation of which is given, the direction of its
tangent; a question whose general solution was the primitive object of
the inventors of the transcendental analysis. We will consider the
tangent as a secant joining two points infinitely near to each other;
and then, designating by _dy_ and _dx_ the infinitely small differences
of the co-ordinates of those two points, the elementary principles of
geometry will immediately give the equation _t_ = _dy_/_dx_ for the
trigonometrical tangent of the angle which is made with the axis of the
abscissas by the desired tangent, this being the most simple way of
fixing its position in a system of rectilinear co-ordinates. This
equation, common to all curves, being established, the question is
reduced to a simple analytical problem, which will consist in
eliminating the infinitesimals _dx_ and _dy_, which were introduced as
auxiliaries, by determining in each particular case, by means of the
equation of the proposed curve, the ratio of _dy_ to _dx_, which will be
constantly done by uniform and very simple methods.


2. _Rectification of an Arc._ In the second place, suppose that we wish
to know the length of the arc of any curve, considered as a function of
the co-ordinates of its extremities. It would be impossible to establish
directly the equation between this arc s and these co-ordinates, while
it is easy to find the corresponding relation between the differentials
of these different magnitudes. The most simple theorems of elementary
geometry will in fact give at once, considering the infinitely small arc
_ds_ as a right line, the equations

  _ds²_ = _dy²_ + _dx²_, or _ds²_ = _dx²_ + _dy²_ + _dz²_,

according as the curve is of single or double curvature. In either case,
the question is now entirely within the domain of analysis, which, by
the elimination of the differentials (which is the peculiar object of
the calculus of indirect functions), will carry us back from this
relation to that which exists between the finite quantities themselves
under examination.


3. _Quadrature of a Curve._ It would be the same with the quadrature of
curvilinear areas. If the curve is a plane one, and referred to
rectilinear co-ordinates, we will conceive the area A comprised between
this curve, the axis of the abscissas, and two extreme co-ordinates, to
increase by an infinitely small quantity _d_A, as the result of a
corresponding increment of the abscissa. The relation between these two
differentials can be immediately obtained with the greatest facility by
substituting for the curvilinear element of the proposed area the
rectangle formed by the extreme ordinate and the element of the
abscissa, from which it evidently differs only by an infinitely small
quantity of the second order. This will at once give, whatever may be
the curve, the very simple differential equation

  _d_A = _ydx_,

from which, when the curve is defined, the calculus of indirect
functions will show how to deduce the finite equation, which is the
immediate object of the problem.


4. _Velocity in Variable Motion._ In like manner, in Dynamics, when we
desire to know the expression for the velocity acquired at each instant
by a body impressed with a motion varying according to any law, we will
consider the motion as being uniform during an infinitely small element
of the time _t_, and we will thus immediately form the differential
equation _de_ = _vdt_, in which _v_ designates the velocity acquired
when the body has passed over the space _e_; and thence it will be easy
to deduce, by simple and invariable analytical procedures, the formula
which would give the velocity in each particular motion, in accordance
with the corresponding relation between the time and the space; or,
reciprocally, what this relation would be if the mode of variation of
the velocity was supposed to be known, whether with respect to the space
or to the time.


5. _Distribution of Heat._ Lastly, to indicate another kind of
questions, it is by similar steps that we are able, in the study of
thermological phenomena, according to the happy conception of M.
Fourier, to form in a very simple manner the general differential
equation which expresses the variable distribution of heat in any body
whatever, subjected to any influences, by means of the single and
easily-obtained relation, which represents the uniform distribution of
heat in a right-angled parallelopipedon, considering (geometrically)
every other body as decomposed into infinitely small elements of a
similar form, and (thermologically) the flow of heat as constant during
an infinitely small element of time. Henceforth, all the questions which
can be presented by abstract thermology will be reduced, as in geometry
and mechanics, to mere difficulties of analysis, which will always
consist in the elimination of the differentials introduced as
auxiliaries to facilitate the establishment of the equations.

Examples of such different natures are more than sufficient to give a
clear general idea of the immense scope of the fundamental conception of
the transcendental analysis as formed by Leibnitz, constituting, as it
undoubtedly does, the most lofty thought to which the human mind has as
yet attained.

It is evident that this conception was indispensable to complete the
foundation of mathematical science, by enabling us to establish, in a
broad and fruitful manner, the relation of the concrete to the abstract.
In this respect it must be regarded as the necessary complement of the
great fundamental idea of Descartes on the general analytical
representation of natural phenomena: an idea which did not begin to be
worthily appreciated and suitably employed till after the formation of
the infinitesimal analysis, without which it could not produce, even in
geometry, very important results.


_Generality of the Formulas._ Besides the admirable facility which is
given by the transcendental analysis for the investigation of the
mathematical laws of all phenomena, a second fundamental and inherent
property, perhaps as important as the first, is the extreme generality
of the differential formulas, which express in a single equation each
determinate phenomenon, however varied the subjects in relation to which
it is considered. Thus we see, in the preceding examples, that a single
differential equation gives the tangents of all curves, another their
rectifications, a third their quadratures; and in the same way, one
invariable formula expresses the mathematical law of every variable
motion; and, finally, a single equation constantly represents the
distribution of heat in any body and for any case. This generality,
which is so exceedingly remarkable, and which is for geometers the basis
of the most elevated considerations, is a fortunate and necessary
consequence of the very spirit of the transcendental analysis,
especially in the conception of Leibnitz. Thus the infinitesimal
analysis has not only furnished a general method for indirectly forming
equations which it would have been impossible to discover in a direct
manner, but it has also permitted us to consider, for the mathematical
study of natural phenomena, a new order of more general laws, which
nevertheless present a clear and precise signification to every mind
habituated to their interpretation. By virtue of this second
characteristic property, the entire system of an immense science, such
as geometry or mechanics, has been condensed into a small number of
analytical formulas, from which the human mind can deduce, by certain
and invariable rules, the solution of all particular problems.


_Demonstration of the Method._ To complete the general exposition of the
conception of Leibnitz, there remains to be considered the demonstration
of the logical procedure to which it leads, and this, unfortunately, is
the most imperfect part of this beautiful method.

In the beginning of the infinitesimal analysis, the most celebrated
geometers rightly attached more importance to extending the immortal
discovery of Leibnitz and multiplying its applications than to
rigorously establishing the logical bases of its operations. They
contented themselves for a long time by answering the objections of
second-rate geometers by the unhoped-for solution of the most difficult
problems; doubtless persuaded that in mathematical science, much more
than in any other, we may boldly welcome new methods, even when their
rational explanation is imperfect, provided they are fruitful in
results, inasmuch as its much easier and more numerous verifications
would not permit any error to remain long undiscovered. But this state
of things could not long exist, and it was necessary to go back to the
very foundations of the analysis of Leibnitz in order to prove, in a
perfectly general manner, the rigorous exactitude of the procedures
employed in this method, in spite of the apparent infractions of the
ordinary rules of reasoning which it permitted.

Leibnitz, urged to answer, had presented an explanation entirely
erroneous, saying that he treated infinitely small quantities as
_incomparables_, and that he neglected them in comparison with finite
quantities, "like grains of sand in comparison with the sea:" a view
which would have completely changed the nature of his analysis, by
reducing it to a mere approximative calculus, which, under this point of
view, would be radically vicious, since it would be impossible to
foresee, in general, to what degree the successive operations might
increase these first errors, which could thus evidently attain any
amount. Leibnitz, then, did not see, except in a very confused manner,
the true logical foundations of the analysis which he had created. His
earliest successors limited themselves, at first, to verifying its
exactitude by showing the conformity of its results, in particular
applications, to those obtained by ordinary algebra or the geometry of
the ancients; reproducing, according to the ancient methods, so far as
they were able, the solutions of some problems after they had been once
obtained by the new method, which alone was capable of discovering them
in the first place.

When this great question was considered in a more general manner,
geometers, instead of directly attacking the difficulty, preferred to
elude it in some way, as Euler and D'Alembert, for example, have done,
by demonstrating the necessary and constant conformity of the conception
of Leibnitz, viewed in all its applications, with other fundamental
conceptions of the transcendental analysis, that of Newton especially,
the exactitude of which was free from any objection. Such a general
verification is undoubtedly strictly sufficient to dissipate any
uncertainty as to the legitimate employment of the analysis of Leibnitz.
But the infinitesimal method is so important--it offers still, in almost
all its applications, such a practical superiority over the other
general conceptions which have been successively proposed--that there
would be a real imperfection in the philosophical character of the
science if it could not justify itself, and needed to be logically
founded on considerations of another order, which would then cease to be
employed.

It was, then, of real importance to establish directly and in a general
manner the necessary rationality of the infinitesimal method. After
various attempts more or less imperfect, a distinguished geometer,
Carnot, presented at last the true direct logical explanation of the
method of Leibnitz, by showing it to be founded on the principle of the
necessary compensation of errors, this being, in fact, the precise and
luminous manifestation of what Leibnitz had vaguely and confusedly
perceived. Carnot has thus rendered the science an essential service,
although, as we shall see towards the end of this chapter, all this
logical scaffolding of the infinitesimal method, properly so called, is
very probably susceptible of only a provisional existence, inasmuch as
it is radically vicious in its nature. Still, we should not fail to
notice the general system of reasoning proposed by Carnot, in order to
directly legitimate the analysis of Leibnitz. Here is the substance of
it:

In establishing the differential equation of a phenomenon, we
substitute, for the immediate elements of the different quantities
considered, other simpler infinitesimals, which differ from them
infinitely little in comparison with them; and this substitution
constitutes the principal artifice of the method of Leibnitz, which
without it would possess no real facility for the formation of
equations. Carnot regards such an hypothesis as really producing an
error in the equation thus obtained, and which for this reason he calls
_imperfect_; only, it is clear that this error must be infinitely small.
Now, on the other hand, all the analytical operations, whether of
differentiation or of integration, which are performed upon these
differential equations, in order to raise them to finite equations by
eliminating all the infinitesimals which have been introduced as
auxiliaries, produce as constantly, by their nature, as is easily seen,
other analogous errors, so that an exact compensation takes place, and
the final equations, in the words of Carnot, become _perfect_. Carnot
views, as a certain and invariable indication of the actual
establishment of this necessary compensation, the complete elimination
of the various infinitely small quantities, which is always, in fact,
the final object of all the operations of the transcendental analysis;
for if we have committed no other infractions of the general rules of
reasoning than those thus exacted by the very nature of the
infinitesimal method, the infinitely small errors thus produced cannot
have engendered other than infinitely small errors in all the equations,
and the relations are necessarily of a rigorous exactitude as soon as
they exist between finite quantities alone, since the only errors then
possible must be finite ones, while none such can have entered. All this
general reasoning is founded on the conception of infinitesimal
quantities, regarded as indefinitely decreasing, while those from which
they are derived are regarded as fixed.


_Illustration by Tangents._ Thus, to illustrate this abstract exposition
by a single example, let us take up again the question of _tangents_,
which is the most easy to analyze completely. We will regard the
equation _t_ = _dy/dx_, obtained above, as being affected with an
infinitely small error, since it would be perfectly rigorous only for
the secant. Now let us complete the solution by seeking, according to
the equation of each curve, the ratio between the differentials of the
co-ordinates. If we suppose this equation to be _y_ = _ax²_, we shall
evidently have

  _dy_ = 2_axdx_ + _adx²_.

In this formula we shall have to neglect the term _dx²_ as an infinitely
small quantity of the second order. Then the combination of the two
_imperfect_ equations.

  _t_ = _dy/dx_, _dy_ = 2_ax(dx)_,

being sufficient to eliminate entirely the infinitesimals, the finite
result, _t_ = 2_ax_, will necessarily be rigorously correct, from the
effect of the exact compensation of the two errors committed; since, by
its finite nature, it cannot be affected by an infinitely small error,
and this is, nevertheless, the only one which it could have, according
to the spirit of the operations which have been executed.

It would be easy to reproduce in a uniform manner the same reasoning
with reference to all the other general applications of the analysis of
Leibnitz.

This ingenious theory is undoubtedly more subtile than solid, when we
examine it more profoundly; but it has really no other radical logical
fault than that of the infinitesimal method itself, of which it is, it
seems to me, the natural development and the general explanation, so
that it must be adopted for as long a time as it shall be thought proper
to employ this method directly.

       *       *       *       *       *

I pass now to the general exposition of the two other fundamental
conceptions of the transcendental analysis, limiting myself in each to
its principal idea, the philosophical character of the analysis having
been sufficiently determined above in the examination of the conception
of Leibnitz, which I have specially dwelt upon because it admits of
being most easily grasped as a whole, and most rapidly described.




METHOD OF NEWTON.


Newton has successively presented his own method of conceiving the
transcendental analysis under several different forms. That which is at
present the most commonly adopted was designated by Newton, sometimes
under the name of the _Method of prime and ultimate Ratios_, sometimes
under that of the _Method of Limits_.


_Method of Limits._ The general spirit of the transcendental analysis,
from this point of view, consists in introducing as auxiliaries, in the
place of the primitive quantities, or concurrently with them, in order
to facilitate the establishment of equations, the _limits of the ratios_
of the simultaneous increments of these quantities; or, in other words,
the _final ratios_ of these increments; limits or final ratios which can
be easily shown to have a determinate and finite value. A special
calculus, which is the equivalent of the infinitesimal calculus, is then
employed to pass from the equations between these limits to the
corresponding equations between the primitive quantities themselves.

The power which is given by such an analysis, of expressing with more
ease the mathematical laws of phenomena, depends in general on this,
that since the calculus applies, not to the increments themselves of the
proposed quantities, but to the limits of the ratios of those
increments, we can always substitute for each increment any other
magnitude more easy to consider, provided that their final ratio is the
ratio of equality, or, in other words, that the limit of their ratio is
unity. It is clear, indeed, that the calculus of limits would be in no
way affected by this substitution. Starting from this principle, we find
nearly the equivalent of the facilities offered by the analysis of
Leibnitz, which are then merely conceived under another point of view.
Thus curves will be regarded as the _limits_ of a series of rectilinear
polygons, variable motions as the _limits_ of a collection of uniform
motions of constantly diminishing durations, and so on.


EXAMPLES. 1. _Tangents._ Suppose, for example, that we wish to determine
the direction of the tangent to a curve; we will regard it as the limit
towards which would tend a secant, which should turn about the given
point so that its second point of intersection should indefinitely
approach the first. Representing the differences of the co-ordinates of
the two points by Δ_y_ and Δ_x_, we would have at each instant, for the
trigonometrical tangent of the angle which the secant makes with the
axis of abscissas,

  _t_ = Δ_y_/Δ_x_;

from which, taking the limits, we will obtain, relatively to the tangent
itself, this general formula of transcendental analysis,

  _t_ = _L_(Δ_y_/Δ_x_),

the characteristic _L_ being employed to designate the limit. The
calculus of indirect functions will show how to deduce from this formula
in each particular case, when the equation of the curve is given, the
relation between _t_ and _x_, by eliminating the auxiliary quantities
which have been introduced. If we suppose, in order to complete the
solution, that the equation of the proposed curve is _y_ = _ax²_, we
shall evidently have

  Δ_y_ = 2_ax_Δ_x_ + _a_(Δ_x_)²,

from which we shall obtain

  Δ_y_/Δ_x_ = 2_ax_ + _a_Δ_x_.

Now it is clear that the _limit_ towards which the second number tends,
in proportion as Δ_x_ diminishes, is 2_ax_. We shall therefore find, by
this method, _t_ = 2_ax_, as we obtained it for the same case by the
method of Leibnitz.

2. _Rectifications._ In like manner, when the rectification of a curve
is desired, we must substitute for the increment of the arc s the chord
of this increment, which evidently has such a connexion with it that the
limit of their ratio is unity; and then we find (pursuing in other
respects the same plan as with the method of Leibnitz) this general
equation of rectifications:

  (_LΔs_/Δ_x_)² = 1 + (_LΔy_/Δ_x_)²,
  or (_LΔs_/Δ_x_)² = 1 + (_LΔy_/Δ_x_)² + (_LΔz_/Δ_x_)²,

according as the curve is plane or of double curvature. It will now be
necessary, for each particular curve, to pass from this equation to that
between the arc and the abscissa, which depends on the transcendental
calculus properly so called.

We could take up, with the same facility, by the method of limits, all
the other general questions, the solution of which has been already
indicated according to the infinitesimal method.

Such is, in substance, the conception which Newton formed for the
transcendental analysis, or, more precisely, that which Maclaurin and
D'Alembert have presented as the most rational basis of that analysis,
in seeking to fix and to arrange the ideas of Newton upon that subject.


_Fluxions and Fluents._ Another distinct form under which Newton has
presented this same method should be here noticed, and deserves
particularly to fix our attention, as much by its ingenious clearness in
some cases as by its having furnished the notation best suited to this
manner of viewing the transcendental analysis, and, moreover, as having
been till lately the special form of the calculus of indirect functions
commonly adopted by the English geometers. I refer to the calculus of
_fluxions_ and of _fluents_, founded on the general idea of
_velocities_.

To facilitate the conception of the fundamental idea, let us consider
every curve as generated by a point impressed with a motion varying
according to any law whatever. The different quantities which the curve
can present, the abscissa, the ordinate, the arc, the area, &c., will be
regarded as simultaneously produced by successive degrees during this
motion. The _velocity_ with which each shall have been described will be
called the _fluxion_ of that quantity, which will be inversely named its
_fluent_. Henceforth the transcendental analysis will consist, according
to this conception, in forming directly the equations between the
fluxions of the proposed quantities, in order to deduce therefrom, by a
special calculus, the equations between the fluents themselves. What
has been stated respecting curves may, moreover, evidently be applied to
any magnitudes whatever, regarded, by the aid of suitable images, as
produced by motion.

It is easy to understand the general and necessary identity of this
method with that of limits complicated with the foreign idea of motion.
In fact, resuming the case of the curve, if we suppose, as we evidently
always may, that the motion of the describing point is uniform in a
certain direction, that of the abscissa, for example, then the fluxion
of the abscissa will be constant, like the element of the time; for all
the other quantities generated, the motion cannot be conceived to be
uniform, except for an infinitely small time. Now the velocity being in
general according to its mechanical conception, the ratio of each space
to the time employed in traversing it, and this time being here
proportional to the increment of the abscissa, it follows that the
fluxions of the ordinate, of the arc, of the area, &c., are really
nothing else (rejecting the intermediate consideration of time) than the
final ratios of the increments of these different quantities to the
increment of the abscissa. This method of fluxions and fluents is, then,
in reality, only a manner of representing, by a comparison borrowed from
mechanics, the method of prime and ultimate ratios, which alone can be
reduced to a calculus. It evidently, then, offers the same general
advantages in the various principal applications of the transcendental
analysis, without its being necessary to present special proofs of
this.




METHOD OF LAGRANGE.


_Derived Functions._ The conception of Lagrange, in its admirable
simplicity, consists in representing the transcendental analysis as a
great algebraic artifice, by which, in order to facilitate the
establishment of equations, we introduce, in the place of the primitive
functions, or concurrently with them, their _derived_ functions; that
is, according to the definition of Lagrange, the coefficient of the
first term of the increment of each function, arranged according to the
ascending powers of the increment of its variable. The special calculus
of indirect functions has for its constant object, here as well as in
the conceptions of Leibnitz and of Newton, to eliminate these
_derivatives_ which have been thus employed as auxiliaries, in order to
deduce from their relations the corresponding equations between the
primitive magnitudes.


_An Extension of ordinary Analysis._ The transcendental analysis is,
then, nothing but a simple though very considerable extension of
ordinary analysis. Geometers have long been accustomed to introduce in
analytical investigations, in the place of the magnitudes themselves
which they wished to study, their different powers, or their logarithms,
or their sines, &c., in order to simplify the equations, and even to
obtain them more easily. This successive _derivation_ is an artifice of
the same nature, only of greater extent, and procuring, in consequence,
much more important resources for this common object.

But, although we can readily conceive, _à priori_, that the auxiliary
consideration of these derivatives _may_ facilitate the establishment
of equations, it is not easy to explain why this _must_ necessarily
follow from this mode of derivation rather than from any other
transformation. Such is the weak point of the great idea of Lagrange.
The precise advantages of this analysis cannot as yet be grasped in an
abstract manner, but only shown by considering separately each principal
question, so that the verification is often exceedingly laborious.


EXAMPLE. _Tangents._ This manner of conceiving the transcendental
analysis may be best illustrated by its application to the most simple
of the problems above examined--that of tangents.

Instead of conceiving the tangent as the prolongation of the infinitely
small element of the curve, according to the notion of Leibnitz--or as
the limit of the secants, according to the ideas of Newton--Lagrange
considers it, according to its simple geometrical character, analogous
to the definitions of the ancients, to be a right line such that no
other right line can pass through the point of contact between it and
the curve. Then, to determine its direction, we must seek the general
expression of its distance from the curve, measured in any direction
whatever--in that of the ordinate, for example--and dispose of the
arbitrary constant relating to the inclination of the right line, which
will necessarily enter into that expression, in such a way as to
diminish that separation as much as possible. Now this distance, being
evidently equal to the difference of the two ordinates of the curve and
of the right line, which correspond to the same new abscissa _x_ + _h_,
will be represented by the formula

  (_f'_(_x_) - _t_)_h_ + _qh²_ + _rh³_ + etc.,

in which _t_ designates, as above, the unknown trigonometrical tangent
of the angle which the required line makes with the axis of abscissas,
and _f'_(_x_) the derived function of the ordinate _f_(_x_). This being
understood, it is easy to see that, by disposing of _t_ so as to make
the first term of the preceding formula equal to zero, we will render
the interval between the two lines the least possible, so that any other
line for which _t_ did not have the value thus determined would
necessarily depart farther from the proposed curve. We have, then, for
the direction of the tangent sought, the general expression _t_ =
_f'_(_x_), a result exactly equivalent to those furnished by the
Infinitesimal Method and the Method of Limits. We have yet to find
_f'_(_x_) in each particular curve, which is a mere question of
analysis, quite identical with those which are presented, at this stage
of the operations, by the other methods.

After these considerations upon the principal general conceptions, we
need not stop to examine some other theories proposed, such as Euler's
_Calculus of Vanishing Quantities_, which are really modifications--more
or less important, and, moreover, no longer used--of the preceding
methods.

I have now to establish the comparison and the appreciation of these
three fundamental methods. Their _perfect and necessary conformity_ is
first to be proven in a general manner.




FUNDAMENTAL IDENTITY OF THE THREE METHODS.


It is, in the first place, evident from what precedes, considering these
three methods as to their actual destination, independently of their
preliminary ideas, that they all consist in the same general logical
artifice, which has been characterized in the first chapter; to wit,
the introduction of a certain system of auxiliary magnitudes, having
uniform relations to those which are the special objects of the inquiry,
and substituted for them expressly to facilitate the analytical
expression of the mathematical laws of the phenomena, although they have
finally to be eliminated by the aid of a special calculus. It is this
which has determined me to regularly define the transcendental analysis
as _the calculus of indirect functions_, in order to mark its true
philosophical character, at the same time avoiding any discussion upon
the best manner of conceiving and applying it. The general effect of
this analysis, whatever the method employed, is, then, to bring every
mathematical question much more promptly within the power of the
_calculus_, and thus to diminish considerably the serious difficulty
which is usually presented by the passage from the concrete to the
abstract. Whatever progress we may make, we can never hope that the
calculus will ever be able to grasp every question of natural
philosophy, geometrical, or mechanical, or thermological, &c.,
immediately upon its birth, which would evidently involve a
contradiction. Every problem will constantly require a certain
preliminary labour to be performed, in which the calculus can be of no
assistance, and which, by its nature, cannot be subjected to abstract
and invariable rules; it is that which has for its special object the
establishment of equations, which form the indispensable starting point
of all analytical researches. But this preliminary labour has been
remarkably simplified by the creation of the transcendental analysis,
which has thus hastened the moment at which the solution admits of the
uniform and precise application of general and abstract methods; by
reducing, in each case, this special labour to the investigation of
equations between the auxiliary magnitudes; from which the calculus then
leads to equations directly referring to the proposed magnitudes, which,
before this admirable conception, it had been necessary to establish
directly and separately. Whether these indirect equations are
_differential_ equations, according to the idea of Leibnitz, or
equations of _limits_, conformably to the conception of Newton, or,
lastly, _derived_ equations, according to the theory of Lagrange, the
general procedure is evidently always the same.

But the coincidence of these three principal methods is not limited to
the common effect which they produce; it exists, besides, in the very
manner of obtaining it. In fact, not only do all three consider, in the
place of the primitive magnitudes, certain auxiliary ones, but, still
farther, the quantities thus introduced as subsidiary are exactly
identical in the three methods, which consequently differ only in the
manner of viewing them. This can be easily shown by taking for the
general term of comparison any one of the three conceptions, especially
that of Lagrange, which is the most suitable to serve as a type, as
being the freest from foreign considerations. Is it not evident, by the
very definition of _derived functions_, that they are nothing else than
what Leibnitz calls _differential coefficients_, or the ratios of the
differential of each function to that of the corresponding variable,
since, in determining the first differential, we will be obliged, by the
very nature of the infinitesimal method, to limit ourselves to taking
the only term of the increment of the function which contains the first
power of the infinitely small increment of the variable? In the same
way, is not the derived function, by its nature, likewise the necessary
_limit_ towards which tends the ratio between the increment of the
primitive function and that of its variable, in proportion as this last
indefinitely diminishes, since it evidently expresses what that ratio
becomes when we suppose the increment of the variable to equal zero?
That which is designated by _dx_/_dy_ in the method of Leibnitz; that
which ought to be noted as _L_(Δ_y_/Δ_x_) in that of Newton; and that
which Lagrange has indicated by _f'_(_x_), is constantly one same
function, seen from three different points of view, the considerations
of Leibnitz and Newton properly consisting in making known two general
necessary properties of the derived function. The transcendental
analysis, examined abstractedly and in its principle, is then always the
same, whatever may be the conception which is adopted, and the
procedures of the calculus of indirect functions are necessarily
identical in these different methods, which in like manner must, for any
application whatever, lead constantly to rigorously uniform results.




COMPARATIVE VALUE OF THE THREE METHODS.


If now we endeavour to estimate the comparative value of these three
equivalent conceptions, we shall find in each advantages and
inconveniences which are peculiar to it, and which still prevent
geometers from confining themselves to any one of them, considered as
final.


_That of Leibnitz._ The conception of Leibnitz presents incontestably,
in all its applications, a very marked superiority, by leading in a much
more rapid manner, and with much less mental effort, to the formation
of equations between the auxiliary magnitudes. It is to its use that we
owe the high perfection which has been acquired by all the general
theories of geometry and mechanics. Whatever may be the different
speculative opinions of geometers with respect to the infinitesimal
method, in an abstract point of view, all tacitly agree in employing it
by preference, as soon as they have to treat a new question, in order
not to complicate the necessary difficulty by this purely artificial
obstacle proceeding from a misplaced obstinacy in adopting a less
expeditious course. Lagrange himself, after having reconstructed the
transcendental analysis on new foundations, has (with that noble
frankness which so well suited his genius) rendered a striking and
decisive homage to the characteristic properties of the conception of
Leibnitz, by following it exclusively in the entire system of his
_Méchanique Analytique_. Such a fact renders any comments unnecessary.

But when we consider the conception of Leibnitz in itself and in its
logical relations, we cannot escape admitting, with Lagrange, that it is
radically vicious in this, that, adopting its own expressions, the
notion of infinitely small quantities is a _false idea_, of which it is
in fact impossible to obtain a clear conception, however we may deceive
ourselves in that matter. Even if we adopt the ingenious idea of the
compensation of errors, as above explained, this involves the radical
inconvenience of being obliged to distinguish in mathematics two classes
of reasonings, those which are perfectly rigorous, and those in which we
designedly commit errors which subsequently have to be compensated. A
conception which leads to such strange consequences is undoubtedly very
unsatisfactory in a logical point of view.

To say, as do some geometers, that it is possible in every case to
reduce the infinitesimal method to that of limits, the logical character
of which is irreproachable, would evidently be to elude the difficulty
rather than to remove it; besides, such a transformation almost entirely
strips the conception of Leibnitz of its essential advantages of
facility and rapidity.

Finally, even disregarding the preceding important considerations, the
infinitesimal method would no less evidently present by its nature the
very serious defect of breaking the unity of abstract mathematics, by
creating a transcendental analysis founded on principles so different
from those which form the basis of the ordinary analysis. This division
of analysis into two worlds almost entirely independent of each other,
tends to hinder the formation of truly general analytical conceptions.
To fully appreciate the consequences of this, we should have to go back
to the state of the science before Lagrange had established a general
and complete harmony between these two great sections.


_That of Newton._ Passing now to the conception of Newton, it is evident
that by its nature it is not exposed to the fundamental logical
objections which are called forth by the method of Leibnitz. The notion
of _limits_ is, in fact, remarkable for its simplicity and its
precision. In the transcendental analysis presented in this manner, the
equations are regarded as exact from their very origin, and the general
rules of reasoning are as constantly observed as in ordinary analysis.
But, on the other hand, it is very far from offering such powerful
resources for the solution of problems as the infinitesimal method. The
obligation which it imposes, of never considering the increments of
magnitudes separately and by themselves, nor even in their ratios, but
only in the limits of those ratios, retards considerably the operations
of the mind in the formation of auxiliary equations. We may even say
that it greatly embarrasses the purely analytical transformations. Thus
the transcendental analysis, considered separately from its
applications, is far from presenting in this method the extent and the
generality which have been imprinted upon it by the conception of
Leibnitz. It is very difficult, for example, to extend the theory of
Newton to functions of several independent variables. But it is
especially with reference to its applications that the relative
inferiority of this theory is most strongly marked.

Several Continental geometers, in adopting the method of Newton as the
more logical basis of the transcendental analysis, have partially
disguised this inferiority by a serious inconsistency, which consists in
applying to this method the notation invented by Leibnitz for the
infinitesimal method, and which is really appropriate to it alone. In
designating by _dy_/_dx_ that which logically ought, in the theory of
limits, to be denoted by _L_(Δ_y_/Δ_x_), and in extending to all the
other analytical conceptions this displacement of signs, they intended,
undoubtedly, to combine the special advantages of the two methods; but,
in reality, they have only succeeded in causing a vicious confusion
between them, a familiarity with which hinders the formation of clear
and exact ideas of either. It would certainly be singular, considering
this usage in itself, that, by the mere means of signs, it could be
possible to effect a veritable combination between two theories so
distinct as those under consideration.

Finally, the method of limits presents also, though in a less degree,
the greater inconvenience, which I have above noted in reference to the
infinitesimal method, of establishing a total separation between the
ordinary and the transcendental analysis; for the idea of _limits_,
though clear and rigorous, is none the less in itself, as Lagrange has
remarked, a foreign idea, upon which analytical theories ought not to be
dependent.


_That of Lagrange._ This perfect unity of analysis, and this purely
abstract character of its fundamental notions, are found in the highest
degree in the conception of Lagrange, and are found there alone; it is,
for this reason, the most rational and the most philosophical of all.
Carefully removing every heterogeneous consideration, Lagrange has
reduced the transcendental analysis to its true peculiar character, that
of presenting a very extensive class of analytical transformations,
which facilitate in a remarkable degree the expression of the conditions
of various problems. At the same time, this analysis is thus necessarily
presented as a simple extension of ordinary analysis; it is only a
higher algebra. All the different parts of abstract mathematics,
previously so incoherent, have from that moment admitted of being
conceived as forming a single system.

Unhappily, this conception, which possesses such fundamental properties,
independently of its so simple and so lucid notation, and which is
undoubtedly destined to become the final theory of transcendental
analysis, because of its high philosophical superiority over all the
other methods proposed, presents in its present state too many
difficulties in its applications, as compared with the conception of
Newton, and still more with that of Leibnitz, to be as yet exclusively
adopted. Lagrange himself has succeeded only with great difficulty in
rediscovering, by his method, the principal results already obtained by
the infinitesimal method for the solution of the general questions of
geometry and mechanics; we may judge from that what obstacles would be
found in treating in the same manner questions which were truly new and
important. It is true that Lagrange, on several occasions, has shown
that difficulties call forth, from men of genius, superior efforts,
capable of leading to the greatest results. It was thus that, in trying
to adapt his method to the examination of the curvature of lines, which
seemed so far from admitting its application, he arrived at that
beautiful theory of contacts which has so greatly perfected that
important part of geometry. But, in spite of such happy exceptions, the
conception of Lagrange has nevertheless remained, as a whole,
essentially unsuited to applications.

The final result of the general comparison which I have too briefly
sketched, is, then, as already suggested, that, in order to really
understand the transcendental analysis, we should not only consider it
in its principles according to the three fundamental conceptions of
Leibnitz, of Newton, and of Lagrange, but should besides accustom
ourselves to carry out almost indifferently, according to these three
principal methods, and especially according to the first and the last,
the solution of all important questions, whether of the pure calculus of
indirect functions or of its applications. This is a course which I
could not too strongly recommend to all those who desire to judge
philosophically of this admirable creation of the human mind, as well as
to those who wish to learn to make use of this powerful instrument with
success and with facility. In all the other parts of mathematical
science, the consideration of different methods for a single class of
questions may be useful, even independently of its historical interest,
but it is not indispensable; here, on the contrary, it is strictly
necessary.

Having determined with precision, in this chapter, the philosophical
character of the calculus of indirect functions, according to the
principal fundamental conceptions of which it admits, we have next to
consider, in the following chapter, the logical division and the general
composition of this calculus.




CHAPTER IV.


THE DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS.


ITS TWO FUNDAMENTAL DIVISIONS.


The _calculus of indirect functions_, in accordance with the
considerations explained in the preceding chapter, is necessarily
divided into two parts (or, more properly, is decomposed into two
different _calculi_ entirely distinct, although intimately connected by
their nature), according as it is proposed to find the relations between
the auxiliary magnitudes (the introduction of which constitutes the
general spirit of this calculus) by means of the relations between the
corresponding primitive magnitudes; or, conversely, to try to discover
these direct equations by means of the indirect equations originally
established. Such is, in fact, constantly the double object of the
transcendental analysis.

These two systems have received different names, according to the point
of view under which this analysis has been regarded. The infinitesimal
method, properly so called, having been the most generally employed for
the reasons which have been given, almost all geometers employ
habitually the denominations of _Differential Calculus_ and of _Integral
Calculus_, established by Leibnitz, and which are, in fact, very
rational consequences of his conception. Newton, in accordance with his
method, named the first the _Calculus of Fluxions_, and the second the
_Calculus of Fluents_, expressions which were commonly employed in
England. Finally, following the eminently philosophical theory founded
by Lagrange, one would be called the _Calculus of Derived Functions_,
and the other the _Calculus of Primitive Functions_. I will continue to
make use of the terms of Leibnitz, as being more convenient for the
formation of secondary expressions, although I ought, in accordance with
the suggestions made in the preceding chapter, to employ concurrently
all the different conceptions, approaching as nearly as possible to that
of Lagrange.




THEIR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER.


The differential calculus is evidently the logical basis of the integral
calculus; for we do not and cannot know how to integrate directly any
other differential expressions than those produced by the
differentiation of the ten simple functions which constitute the general
elements of our analysis. The art of integration consists, then,
essentially in bringing all the other cases, as far as is possible, to
finally depend on only this small number of fundamental integrations.

In considering the whole body of the transcendental analysis, as I have
characterized it in the preceding chapter, it is not at first apparent
what can be the peculiar utility of the differential calculus,
independently of this necessary relation with the integral calculus,
which seems as if it must be, by itself, the only one directly
indispensable. In fact, the elimination of the _infinitesimals_ or of
the _derivatives_, introduced as auxiliaries to facilitate the
establishment of equations, constituting, as we have seen, the final and
invariable object of the calculus of indirect functions, it is natural
to think that the calculus which teaches how to deduce from the
equations between these auxiliary magnitudes, those which exist between
the primitive magnitudes themselves, ought strictly to suffice for the
general wants of the transcendental analysis without our perceiving, at
the first glance, what special and constant part the solution of the
inverse question can have in such an analysis. It would be a real error,
though a common one, to assign to the differential calculus, in order to
explain its peculiar, direct, and necessary influence, the destination
of forming the differential equations, from which the integral calculus
then enables us to arrive at the finite equations; for the primitive
formation of differential equations is not and cannot be, properly
speaking, the object of any calculus, since, on the contrary, it forms
by its nature the indispensable starting point of any calculus whatever.
How, in particular, could the differential calculus, which in itself is
reduced to teaching the means of _differentiating_ the different
equations, be a general procedure for establishing them? That which in
every application of the transcendental analysis really facilitates the
formation of equations, is the infinitesimal _method_, and not the
infinitesimal _calculus_, which is perfectly distinct from it, although
it is its indispensable complement. Such a consideration would, then,
give a false idea of the special destination which characterizes the
differential calculus in the general system of the transcendental
analysis.

But we should nevertheless very imperfectly conceive the real peculiar
importance of this first branch of the calculus of indirect functions,
if we saw in it only a simple preliminary labour, having no other
general and essential object than to prepare indispensable foundations
for the integral calculus. As the ideas on this matter are generally
confused, I think that I ought here to explain in a summary manner this
important relation as I view it, and to show that in every application
of the transcendental analysis a primary, direct, and necessary part is
constantly assigned to the differential calculus.


1. _Use of the Differential Calculus as preparatory to that of the
Integral._ In forming the differential equations of any phenomenon
whatever, it is very seldom that we limit ourselves to introduce
differentially only those magnitudes whose relations are sought. To
impose that condition would be to uselessly diminish the resources
presented by the transcendental analysis for the expression of the
mathematical laws of phenomena. Most frequently we introduce into the
primitive equations, through their differentials, other magnitudes whose
relations are already known or supposed to be so, and without the
consideration of which it would be frequently impossible to establish
equations. Thus, for example, in the general problem of the
rectification of curves, the differential equation,

  _ds_² = _dy_² + _dx_², or _ds_² = _dx_² + _dy_² + _dz_²,

is not only established between the desired function s and the
independent variable _x_, to which it is referred, but, at the same
time, there have been introduced, as indispensable intermediaries, the
differentials of one or two other functions, _y_ and _z_, which are
among the data of the problem; it would not have been possible to form
directly the equation between _ds_ and _dx_, which would, besides, be
peculiar to each curve considered. It is the same for most questions.
Now in these cases it is evident that the differential equation is not
immediately suitable for integration. It is previously necessary that
the differentials of the functions supposed to be known, which have
been employed as intermediaries, should be entirely eliminated, in order
that equations may be obtained between the differentials of the
functions which alone are sought and those of the really independent
variables, after which the question depends on only the integral
calculus. Now this preparatory elimination of certain differentials, in
order to reduce the infinitesimals to the smallest number possible,
belongs simply to the differential calculus; for it must evidently be
done by determining, by means of the equations between the functions
supposed to be known, taken as intermediaries, the relations of their
differentials, which is merely a question of differentiation. Thus, for
example, in the case of rectifications, it will be first necessary to
calculate _dy_, or _dy_ and _dz_, by differentiating the equation or the
equations of each curve proposed; after eliminating these expressions,
the general differential formula above enunciated will then contain only
_ds_ and _dx_; having arrived at this point, the elimination of the
infinitesimals can be completed only by the integral calculus.

Such is, then, the general office necessarily belonging to the
differential calculus in the complete solution of the questions which
exact the employment of the transcendental analysis; to produce, as far
as is possible, the elimination of the infinitesimals, that is, to
reduce in each case the primitive differential equations so that they
shall contain only the differentials of the really independent
variables, and those of the functions sought, by causing to disappear,
by elimination, the differentials of all the other known functions which
may have been taken as intermediaries at the time of the formation of
the differential equations of the problem which is under consideration.


2. _Employment of the Differential Calculus alone._ For certain
questions, which, although few in number, have none the less, as we
shall see hereafter, a very great importance, the magnitudes which are
sought enter directly, and not by their differentials, into the
primitive differential equations, which then contain differentially only
the different known functions employed as intermediaries, in accordance
with the preceding explanation. These cases are the most favourable of
all; for it is evident that the differential calculus is then entirely
sufficient for the complete elimination of the infinitesimals, without
the question giving rise to any integration. This is what occurs, for
example, in the problem of _tangents_ in geometry; in that of
_velocities_ in mechanics, &c.


3. _Employment of the Integral Calculus alone._ Finally, some other
questions, the number of which is also very small, but the importance of
which is no less great, present a second exceptional case, which is in
its nature exactly the converse of the preceding. They are those in
which the differential equations are found to be immediately ready for
integration, because they contain, at their first formation, only the
infinitesimals which relate to the functions sought, or to the really
independent variables, without its being necessary to introduce,
differentially, other functions as intermediaries. If in these new cases
we introduce these last functions, since, by hypothesis, they will enter
directly and not by their differentials, ordinary algebra will suffice
to eliminate them, and to bring the question to depend on only the
integral calculus. The differential calculus will then have no special
part in the complete solution of the problem, which will depend entirely
upon the integral calculus. The general question of _quadratures_ offers
an important example of this, for the differential equation being then
_dA = ydx_, will become immediately fit for integration as soon as we
shall have eliminated, by means of the equation of the proposed curve,
the intermediary function _y_, which does not enter into it
differentially. The same circumstances exist in the problem of
_cubatures_, and in some others equally important.


_Three classes of Questions hence resulting._ As a general result of the
previous considerations, it is then necessary to divide into three
classes the mathematical questions which require the use of the
transcendental analysis; the _first_ class comprises the problems
susceptible of being entirely resolved by means of the differential
calculus alone, without any need of the integral calculus; the _second_,
those which are, on the contrary, entirely dependent upon the integral
calculus, without the differential calculus having any part in their
solution; lastly, in the _third_ and the most extensive, which
constitutes the normal case, the two others being only exceptional, the
differential and the integral calculus have each in their turn a
distinct and necessary part in the complete solution of the problem, the
former making the primitive differential equations undergo a preparation
which is indispensable for the application of the latter. Such are
exactly their general relations, of which too indefinite and inexact
ideas are generally formed.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let us now take a general survey of the logical composition of each
calculus, beginning with the differential.




THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS.


In the exposition of the transcendental analysis, it is customary to
intermingle with the purely analytical part (which reduces itself to the
treatment of the abstract principles of differentiation and integration)
the study of its different principal applications, especially those
which concern geometry. This confusion of ideas, which is a consequence
of the actual manner in which the science has been developed, presents,
in the dogmatic point of view, serious inconveniences in this respect,
that it makes it difficult properly to conceive either analysis or
geometry. Having to consider here the most rational co-ordination which
is possible, I shall include, in the following sketch, only the calculus
of indirect functions properly so called, reserving for the portion of
this volume which relates to the philosophical study of _concrete_
mathematics the general examination of its great geometrical and
mechanical applications.


_Two Cases: explicit and implicit Functions._ The fundamental division
of the differential calculus, or of the general subject of
differentiation, consists in distinguishing two cases, according as the
analytical functions which are to be differentiated are _explicit_ or
_implicit_; from which flow two parts ordinarily designated by the names
of differentiation _of formulas_ and differentiation _of equations_. It
is easy to understand, _à priori_, the importance of this
classification. In fact, such a distinction would be illusory if the
ordinary analysis was perfect; that is, if we knew how to resolve all
equations algebraically, for then it would be possible to render every
_implicit_ function _explicit_; and, by differentiating it in that
state alone, the second part of the differential calculus would be
immediately comprised in the first, without giving rise to any new
difficulty. But the algebraical resolution of equations being, as we
have seen, still almost in its infancy, and as yet impossible for most
cases, it is plain that the case is very different, since we have,
properly speaking, to differentiate a function without knowing it,
although it is determinate. The differentiation of implicit functions
constitutes then, by its nature, a question truly distinct from that
presented by explicit functions, and necessarily more complicated. It is
thus evident that we must commence with the differentiation of formulas,
and reduce the differentiation of equations to this primary case by
certain invariable analytical considerations, which need not be here
mentioned.

These two general cases of differentiation are also distinct in another
point of view equally necessary, and too important to be left unnoticed.
The relation which is obtained between the differentials is constantly
more indirect, in comparison with that of the finite quantities, in the
differentiation of implicit functions than in that of explicit
functions. We know, in fact, from the considerations presented by
Lagrange on the general formation of differential equations, that, on
the one hand, the same primitive equation may give rise to a greater or
less number of derived equations of very different forms, although at
bottom equivalent, depending upon which of the arbitrary constants is
eliminated, which is not the case in the differentiation of explicit
formulas; and that, on the other hand, the unlimited system of the
different primitive equations, which correspond to the same derived
equation, presents a much more profound analytical variety than that of
the different functions, which admit of one same explicit differential,
and which are distinguished from each other only by a constant term.
Implicit functions must therefore be regarded as being in reality still
more modified by differentiation than explicit functions. We shall again
meet with this consideration relatively to the integral calculus, where
it acquires a preponderant importance.


_Two Sub-cases: A single Variable or several Variables._ Each of the two
fundamental parts of the Differential Calculus is subdivided into two
very distinct theories, according as we are required to differentiate
functions of a single variable or functions of several independent
variables. This second case is, by its nature, quite distinct from the
first, and evidently presents more complication, even in considering
only explicit functions, and still more those which are implicit. As to
the rest, one of these cases is deduced from the other in a general
manner, by the aid of an invariable and very simple principle, which
consists in regarding the total differential of a function which is
produced by the simultaneous increments of the different independent
variables which it contains, as the sum of the partial differentials
which would be produced by the separate increment of each variable in
turn, if all the others were constant. It is necessary, besides,
carefully to remark, in connection with this subject, a new idea which
is introduced by the distinction of functions into those of one variable
and of several; it is the consideration of these different special
derived functions, relating to each variable separately, and the number
of which increases more and more in proportion as the order of the
derivation becomes higher, and also when the variables become more
numerous. It results from this that the differential relations belonging
to functions of several variables are, by their nature, both much more
indirect, and especially much more indeterminate, than those relating to
functions of a single variable. This is most apparent in the case of
implicit functions, in which, in the place of the simple arbitrary
constants which elimination causes to disappear when we form the proper
differential equations for functions of a single variable, it is the
arbitrary functions of the proposed variables which are then eliminated;
whence must result special difficulties when these equations come to be
integrated.

Finally, to complete this summary sketch of the different essential
parts of the differential calculus proper, I should add, that in the
differentiation of implicit functions, whether of a single variable or
of several, it is necessary to make another distinction; that of the
case in which it is required to differentiate at once different
functions of this kind, _combined_ in certain primitive equations, from
that in which all these functions are _separate_.

The functions are evidently, in fact, still more implicit in the first
case than in the second, if we consider that the same imperfection of
ordinary analysis, which forbids our converting every implicit function
into an equivalent explicit function, in like manner renders us unable
to separate the functions which enter simultaneously into any system of
equations. It is then necessary to differentiate, not only without
knowing how to resolve the primitive equations, but even without being
able to effect the proper eliminations among them, thus producing a new
difficulty.


_Reduction of the whole to the Differentiation of the ten elementary
Functions._ Such, then, are the natural connection and the logical
distribution of the different principal theories which compose the
general system of differentiation. Since the differentiation of implicit
functions is deduced from that of explicit functions by a single
constant principle, and the differentiation of functions of several
variables is reduced by another fixed principle to that of functions of
a single variable, the whole of the differential calculus is finally
found to rest upon the differentiation of explicit functions with a
single variable, the only one which is ever executed directly. Now it is
easy to understand that this first theory, the necessary basis of the
entire system, consists simply in the differentiation of the ten simple
functions, which are the uniform elements of all our analytical
combinations, and the list of which has been given in the first chapter,
on page 51; for the differentiation of compound functions is evidently
deduced, in an immediate and necessary manner, from that of the simple
functions which compose them. It is, then, to the knowledge of these ten
fundamental differentials, and to that of the two general principles
just mentioned, which bring under it all the other possible cases, that
the whole system of differentiation is properly reduced. We see, by the
combination of these different considerations, how simple and how
perfect is the entire system of the differential calculus. It certainly
constitutes, in its logical relations, the most interesting spectacle
which mathematical analysis can present to our understanding.


_Transformation of derived Functions for new Variables._ The general
sketch which I have just summarily drawn would nevertheless present an
important deficiency, if I did not here distinctly indicate a final
theory, which forms, by its nature, the indispensable complement of the
system of differentiation. It is that which has for its object the
constant transformation of derived functions, as a result of determinate
changes in the independent variables, whence results the possibility of
referring to new variables all the general differential formulas
primitively established for others. This question is now resolved in the
most complete and the most simple manner, as are all those of which the
differential calculus is composed. It is easy to conceive the general
importance which it must have in any of the applications of the
transcendental analysis, the fundamental resources of which it may be
considered as augmenting, by permitting us to choose (in order to form
the differential equations, in the first place, with more ease) that
system of independent variables which may appear to be the most
advantageous, although it is not to be finally retained. It is thus, for
example, that most of the principal questions of geometry are resolved
much more easily by referring the lines and surfaces to _rectilinear_
co-ordinates, and that we may, nevertheless, have occasion to express
these lines, etc., analytically by the aid of _polar_ co-ordinates, or
in any other manner. We will then be able to commence the differential
solution of the problem by employing the rectilinear system, but only as
an intermediate step, from which, by the general theory here referred
to, we can pass to the final system, which sometimes could not have been
considered directly.


_Different Orders of Differentiation._ In the logical classification of
the differential calculus which has just been given, some may be
inclined to suggest a serious omission, since I have not subdivided each
of its four essential parts according to another general consideration,
which seems at first view very important; namely, that of the higher or
lower order of differentiation. But it is easy to understand that this
distinction has no real influence in the differential calculus, inasmuch
as it does not give rise to any new difficulty. If, indeed, the
differential calculus was not rigorously complete, that is, if we did
not know how to differentiate at will any function whatever, the
differentiation to the second or higher order of each determinate
function might engender special difficulties. But the perfect
universality of the differential calculus plainly gives us the assurance
of being able to differentiate, to any order whatever, all known
functions whatever, the question reducing itself to a constantly
repeated differentiation of the first order. This distinction,
unimportant as it is for the differential calculus, acquires, however, a
very great importance in the integral calculus, on account of the
extreme imperfection of the latter.


_Analytical Applications._ Finally, though this is not the place to
consider the various applications of the differential calculus, yet an
exception may be made for those which consist in the solution of
questions which are purely analytical, which ought, indeed, to be
logically treated in continuation of a system of differentiation,
because of the evident homogeneity of the considerations involved. These
questions may be reduced to three essential ones.

Firstly, the _development into series_ of functions of one or more
variables, or, more generally, the transformation of functions, which
constitutes the most beautiful and the most important application of the
differential calculus to general analysis, and which comprises, besides
the fundamental series discovered by Taylor, the remarkable series
discovered by Maclaurin, John Bernouilli, Lagrange, &c.:

Secondly, the general _theory of maxima and minima_ values for any
functions whatever, of one or more variables; one of the most
interesting problems which analysis can present, however elementary it
may now have become, and to the complete solution of which the
differential calculus naturally applies:

Thirdly, the general determination of the true value of functions which
present themselves under an _indeterminate_ appearance for certain
hypotheses made on the values of the corresponding variables; which is
the least extensive and the least important of the three.

The first question is certainly the principal one in all points of view;
it is also the most susceptible of receiving a new extension hereafter,
especially by conceiving, in a broader manner than has yet been done,
the employment of the differential calculus in the transformation of
functions, on which subject Lagrange has left some valuable hints.

       *       *       *       *       *

Having thus summarily, though perhaps too briefly, considered the chief
points in the differential calculus, I now proceed to an equally rapid
exposition of a systematic outline of the Integral Calculus, properly so
called, that is, the abstract subject of integration.




THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS.


_Its Fundamental Division._ The fundamental division of the Integral
Calculus is founded on the same principle as that of the Differential
Calculus, in distinguishing the integration of _explicit_ differential
formulas, and the integration of _implicit_ differentials or of
differential equations. The separation of these two cases is even much
more profound in relation to integration than to differentiation. In the
differential calculus, in fact, this distinction rests, as we have seen,
only on the extreme imperfection of ordinary analysis. But, on the other
hand, it is easy to see that, even though all equations could be
algebraically resolved, differential equations would none the less
constitute a case of integration quite distinct from that presented by
the explicit differential formulas; for, limiting ourselves, for the
sake of simplicity, to the first order, and to a single function _y_ of
a single variable _x_, if we suppose any differential equation between
_x_, _y_, and _dy/dx_, to be resolved with reference to _dy/dx_, the
expression of the derived function being then generally found to contain
the primitive function itself, which is the object of the inquiry, the
question of integration will not have at all changed its nature, and the
solution will not really have made any other progress than that of
having brought the proposed differential equation to be of only the
first degree relatively to the derived function, which is in itself of
little importance. The differential would not then be determined in a
manner much less _implicit_ than before, as regards the integration,
which would continue to present essentially the same characteristic
difficulty. The algebraic resolution of equations could not make the
case which we are considering come within the simple integration of
explicit differentials, except in the special cases in which the
proposed differential equation did not contain the primitive function
itself, which would consequently permit us, by resolving it, to find
_dy/dx_ in terms of _x_ only, and thus to reduce the question to the
class of quadratures. Still greater difficulties would evidently be
found in differential equations of higher orders, or containing
simultaneously different functions of several independent variables.

The integration of differential equations is then necessarily more
complicated than that of explicit differentials, by the elaboration of
which last the integral calculus has been created, and upon which the
others have been made to depend as far as it has been possible. All the
various analytical methods which have been proposed for integrating
differential equations, whether it be the separation of the variables,
the method of multipliers, &c., have in fact for their object to reduce
these integrations to those of differential formulas, the only one
which, by its nature, can be undertaken directly. Unfortunately,
imperfect as is still this necessary base of the whole integral
calculus, the art of reducing to it the integration of differential
equations is still less advanced.


_Subdivisions: one variable or several._ Each of these two fundamental
branches of the integral calculus is next subdivided into two others (as
in the differential calculus, and for precisely analogous reasons),
according as we consider functions with a _single variable_, or
functions with _several independent variables_.

This distinction is, like the preceding one, still more important for
integration than for differentiation. This is especially remarkable in
reference to differential equations. Indeed, those which depend on
several independent variables may evidently present this characteristic
and much more serious difficulty, that the desired function may be
differentially defined by a simple relation between its different
special derivatives relative to the different variables taken
separately. Hence results the most difficult and also the most extensive
branch of the integral calculus, which is commonly named the _Integral
Calculus of partial differences_, created by D'Alembert, and in which,
according to the just appreciation of Lagrange, geometers ought to have
seen a really new calculus, the philosophical character of which has not
yet been determined with sufficient exactness. A very striking
difference between this case and that of equations with a single
independent variable consists, as has been already observed, in the
arbitrary functions which take the place of the simple arbitrary
constants, in order to give to the corresponding integrals all the
proper generality.

It is scarcely necessary to say that this higher branch of
transcendental analysis is still entirely in its infancy, since, even in
the most simple case, that of an equation of the first order between the
partial derivatives of a single function with two independent variables,
we are not yet completely able to reduce the integration to that of the
ordinary differential equations. The integration of functions of several
variables is much farther advanced in the case (infinitely more simple
indeed) in which it has to do with only explicit differential formulas.
We can then, in fact, when these formulas fulfil the necessary
conditions of integrability, always reduce their integration to
quadratures.


_Other Subdivisions: different Orders of Differentiation._ A new general
distinction, applicable as a subdivision to the integration of explicit
or implicit differentials, with one variable or several, is drawn from
the _higher or lower order of the differentials_: a distinction which,
as we have above remarked, does not give rise to any special question in
the differential calculus.

Relatively to _explicit differentials_, whether of one variable or of
several, the necessity of distinguishing their different orders belongs
only to the extreme imperfection of the integral calculus. In fact, if
we could always integrate every differential formula of the first order,
the integration of a formula of the second order, or of any other, would
evidently not form a new question, since, by integrating it at first in
the first degree, we would arrive at the differential expression of the
immediately preceding order, from which, by a suitable series of
analogous integrations, we would be certain of finally arriving at the
primitive function, the final object of these operations. But the little
knowledge which we possess on integration of even the first order causes
quite another state of affairs, so that a higher order of differentials
produces new difficulties; for, having differential formulas of any
order above the first, it may happen that we may be able to integrate
them, either once, or several times in succession, and that we may still
be unable to go back to the primitive functions, if these preliminary
labours have produced, for the differentials of a lower order,
expressions whose integrals are not known. This circumstance must occur
so much the oftener (the number of known integrals being still very
small), seeing that these successive integrals are generally very
different functions from the derivatives which have produced them.

With reference to _implicit differentials_, the distinction of orders is
still more important; for, besides the preceding reason, the influence
of which is evidently analogous in this case, and is even greater, it is
easy to perceive that the higher order of the differential equations
necessarily gives rise to questions of a new nature. In fact, even if we
could integrate every equation of the first order relating to a single
function, that would not be sufficient for obtaining the final integral
of an equation of any order whatever, inasmuch as every differential
equation is not reducible to that of an immediately inferior order.
Thus, for example, if we have given any relation between _x_, _y_,
_dx/dy_, and _d_²_y_/_dx_², to determine a function _y_ of a variable
_x_, we shall not be able to deduce from it at once, after effecting a
first integration, the corresponding differential relation between _x_,
_y_, and _dy/dx_, from which, by a second integration, we could ascend
to the primitive equations. This would not necessarily take place, at
least without introducing new auxiliary functions, unless the proposed
equation of the second order did not contain the required function _y_,
together with its derivatives. As a general principle, differential
equations will have to be regarded as presenting cases which are more
and more _implicit_, as they are of a higher order, and which cannot be
made to depend on one another except by special methods, the
investigation of which consequently forms a new class of questions, with
respect to which we as yet know scarcely any thing, even for functions
of a single variable.[10]

  [Footnote 10: The only important case of this class which has thus
  far been completely treated is the general integration of _linear_
  equations of any order whatever, with constant coefficients. Even
  this case finally depends on the algebraic resolution of equations
  of a degree equal to the order of differentiation.]

_Another equivalent distinction._ Still farther, when we examine more
profoundly this distinction of different orders of differential
equations, we find that it can be always made to come under a final
general distinction, relative to differential equations, which remains
to be noticed. Differential equations with one or more independent
variables may contain simply a single function, or (in a case evidently
more complicated and more implicit, which corresponds to the
differentiation of simultaneous implicit functions) we may have to
determine at the same time several functions from the differential
equations in which they are found united, together with their different
derivatives. It is clear that such a state of the question necessarily
presents a new special difficulty, that of separating the different
functions desired, by forming for each, from the proposed differential
equations, an isolated differential equation which does not contain the
other functions or their derivatives. This preliminary labour, which is
analogous to the elimination of algebra, is evidently indispensable
before attempting any direct integration, since we cannot undertake
generally (except by special artifices which are very rarely applicable)
to determine directly several distinct functions at once.

Now it is easy to establish the exact and necessary coincidence of this
new distinction with the preceding one respecting the order of
differential equations. We know, in fact, that the general method for
isolating functions in simultaneous differential equations consists
essentially in forming differential equations, separately in relation to
each function, and of an order equal to the sum of all those of the
different proposed equations. This transformation can always be
effected. On the other hand, every differential equation of any order in
relation to a single function might evidently always be reduced to the
first order, by introducing a suitable number of auxiliary differential
equations, containing at the same time the different anterior
derivatives regarded as new functions to be determined. This method has,
indeed, sometimes been actually employed with success, though it is not
the natural one.

Here, then, are two necessarily equivalent orders of conditions in the
general theory of differential equations; the simultaneousness of a
greater or smaller number of functions, and the higher or lower order of
differentiation of a single function. By augmenting the order of the
differential equations, we can isolate all the functions; and, by
artificially multiplying the number of the functions, we can reduce all
the equations to the first order. There is, consequently, in both cases,
only one and the same difficulty from two different points of sight.
But, however we may conceive it, this new difficulty is none the less
real, and constitutes none the less, by its nature, a marked separation
between the integration of equations of the first order and that of
equations of a higher order. I prefer to indicate the distinction under
this last form as being more simple, more general, and more logical.


_Quadratures._ From the different considerations which have been
indicated respecting the logical dependence of the various principal
parts of the integral calculus, we see that the integration of explicit
differential formulas of the first order and of a single variable is the
necessary basis of all other integrations, which we never succeed in
effecting but so far as we reduce them to this elementary case,
evidently the only one which, by its nature, is capable of being treated
directly. This simple fundamental integration is often designated by the
convenient expression of _quadratures_, seeing that every integral of
this kind, S_f_(_x_)_dx_, may, in fact, be regarded as representing the
area of a curve, the equation of which in rectilinear co-ordinates would
be _y_ = _f_(_x_). Such a class of questions corresponds, in the
differential calculus, to the elementary case of the differentiation of
explicit functions of a single variable. But the integral question is,
by its nature, very differently complicated, and especially much more
extensive than the differential question. This latter is, in fact,
necessarily reduced, as we have seen, to the differentiation of the ten
simple functions, the elements of all which are considered in analysis.
On the other hand, the integration of compound functions does not
necessarily follow from that of the simple functions, each combination
of which may present special difficulties with respect to the integral
calculus. Hence results the naturally indefinite extent, and the so
varied complication of the question of _quadratures_, upon which, in
spite of all the efforts of analysts, we still possess so little
complete knowledge.

In decomposing this question, as is natural, according to the different
forms which may be assumed by the derivative function, we distinguish
the case of _algebraic_ functions and that of _transcendental_
functions.

_Integration of Transcendental Functions._ The truly analytical
integration of transcendental functions is as yet very little advanced,
whether for _exponential_, or for _logarithmic_, or for _circular_
functions. But a very small number of cases of these three different
kinds have as yet been treated, and those chosen from among the
simplest; and still the necessary calculations are in most cases
extremely laborious. A circumstance which we ought particularly to
remark in its philosophical connection is, that the different procedures
of quadrature have no relation to any general view of integration, and
consist of simple artifices very incoherent with each other, and very
numerous, because of the very limited extent of each.

One of these artifices should, however, here be noticed, which, without
being really a method of integration, is nevertheless remarkable for its
generality; it is the procedure invented by John Bernouilli, and known
under the name of _integration by parts_, by means of which every
integral may be reduced to another which is sometimes found to be more
easy to be obtained. This ingenious relation deserves to be noticed for
another reason, as having suggested the first idea of that
transformation of integrals yet unknown, which has lately received a
greater extension, and of which M. Fourier especially has made so new
and important a use in the analytical questions produced by the theory
of heat.

_Integration of Algebraic Functions._ As to the integration of algebraic
functions, it is farther advanced. However, we know scarcely any thing
in relation to irrational functions, the integrals of which have been
obtained only in extremely limited cases, and particularly by rendering
them rational. The integration of rational functions is thus far the
only theory of the integral calculus which has admitted of being treated
in a truly complete manner; in a logical point of view, it forms, then,
its most satisfactory part, but perhaps also the least important. It is
even essential to remark, in order to have a just idea of the extreme
imperfection of the integral calculus, that this case, limited as it is,
is not entirely resolved except for what properly concerns integration
viewed in an abstract manner; for, in the execution, the theory finds
its progress most frequently quite stopped, independently of the
complication of the calculations, by the imperfection of ordinary
analysis, seeing that it makes the integration finally depend upon the
algebraic resolution of equations, which greatly limits its use.

To grasp in a general manner the spirit of the different procedures
which are employed in quadratures, we must observe that, by their
nature, they can be primitively founded only on the differentiation of
the ten simple functions. The results of this, conversely considered,
establish as many direct theorems of the integral calculus, the only
ones which can be directly known. All the art of integration afterwards
consists, as has been said in the beginning of this chapter, in reducing
all the other quadratures, so far as is possible, to this small number
of elementary ones, which unhappily we are in most cases unable to
effect.

_Singular Solutions._ In this systematic enumeration of the various
essential parts of the integral calculus, considered in their logical
relations, I have designedly neglected (in order not to break the chain
of sequence) to consider a very important theory, which forms implicitly
a portion of the general theory of the integration of differential
equations, but which I ought here to notice separately, as being, so to
speak, outside of the integral calculus, and being nevertheless of the
greatest interest, both by its logical perfection and by the extent of
its applications. I refer to what are called _Singular Solutions_ of
differential equations, called sometimes, but improperly, _particular_
solutions, which have been the subject of very remarkable investigations
by Euler and Laplace, and of which Lagrange especially has presented
such a beautiful and simple general theory. Clairaut, who first had
occasion to remark their existence, saw in them a paradox of the
integral calculus, since these solutions have the peculiarity of
satisfying the differential equations without being comprised in the
corresponding general integrals. Lagrange has since explained this
paradox in the most ingenious and most satisfactory manner, by showing
how such solutions are always derived from the general integral by the
variation of the arbitrary constants. He was also the first to suitably
appreciate the importance of this theory, and it is with good reason
that he devoted to it so full a development in his "Calculus of
Functions." In a logical point of view, this theory deserves all our
attention by the character of perfect generality which it admits of,
since Lagrange has given invariable and very simple procedures for
finding the _singular_ solution of any differential equation which is
susceptible of it; and, what is no less remarkable, these procedures
require no integration, consisting only of differentiations, and are
therefore always applicable. Differentiation has thus become, by a
happy artifice, a means of compensating, in certain circumstances, for
the imperfection of the integral calculus. Indeed, certain problems
especially require, by their nature, the knowledge of these _singular_
solutions; such, for example, in geometry, are all the questions in
which a curve is to be determined from any property of its tangent or
its osculating circle. In all cases of this kind, after having expressed
this property by a differential equation, it will be, in its analytical
relations, the _singular_ equation which will form the most important
object of the inquiry, since it alone will represent the required curve;
the general integral, which thenceforth it becomes unnecessary to know,
designating only the system of the tangents, or of the osculating
circles of this curve. We may hence easily understand all the importance
of this theory, which seems to me to be not as yet sufficiently
appreciated by most geometers.

_Definite Integrals._ Finally, to complete our review of the vast
collection of analytical researches of which is composed the integral
calculus, properly so called, there remains to be mentioned one theory,
very important in all the applications of the transcendental analysis,
which I have had to leave outside of the system, as not being really
destined for veritable integration, and proposing, on the contrary, to
supply the place of the knowledge of truly analytical integrals, which
are most generally unknown. I refer to the determination of _definite
integrals_.

The expression, always possible, of integrals in infinite series, may at
first be viewed as a happy general means of compensating for the extreme
imperfection of the integral calculus. But the employment of such
series, because of their complication, and of the difficulty of
discovering the law of their terms, is commonly of only moderate utility
in the algebraic point of view, although sometimes very essential
relations have been thence deduced. It is particularly in the
arithmetical point of view that this procedure acquires a great
importance, as a means of calculating what are called _definite
integrals_, that is, the values of the required functions for certain
determinate values of the corresponding variables.

An inquiry of this nature exactly corresponds, in transcendental
analysis, to the numerical resolution of equations in ordinary analysis.
Being generally unable to obtain the veritable integral--named by
opposition the _general_ or _indefinite_ integral; that is, the function
which, differentiated, has produced the proposed differential
formula--analysts have been obliged to employ themselves in determining
at least, without knowing this function, the particular numerical values
which it would take on assigning certain designated values to the
variables. This is evidently resolving the arithmetical question without
having previously resolved the corresponding algebraic one, which most
generally is the most important one. Such an analysis is, then, by its
nature, as imperfect as we have seen the numerical resolution of
equations to be. It presents, like this last, a vicious confusion of
arithmetical and algebraic considerations, whence result analogous
inconveniences both in the purely logical point of view and in the
applications. We need not here repeat the considerations suggested in
our third chapter. But it will be understood that, unable as we almost
always are to obtain the true integrals, it is of the highest importance
to have been able to obtain this solution, incomplete and necessarily
insufficient as it is. Now this has been fortunately attained at the
present day for all cases, the determination of the value of definite
integrals having been reduced to entirely general methods, which leave
nothing to desire, in a great number of cases, but less complication in
the calculations, an object towards which are at present directed all
the special transformations of analysts. Regarding now this sort of
_transcendental arithmetic_ as perfect, the difficulty in the
applications is essentially reduced to making the proposed research
depend, finally, on a simple determination of definite integrals, which
evidently cannot always be possible, whatever analytical skill may be
employed in effecting such a transformation.


_Prospects of the Integral Calculus._ From the considerations indicated
in this chapter, we see that, while the differential calculus
constitutes by its nature a limited and perfect system, to which nothing
essential remains to be added, the integral calculus, or the simple
system of integration, presents necessarily an inexhaustible field for
the activity of the human mind, independently of the indefinite
applications of which the transcendental analysis is evidently
susceptible. The general argument by which I have endeavoured, in the
second chapter, to make apparent the impossibility of ever discovering
the algebraic solution of equations of any degree and form whatsoever,
has undoubtedly infinitely more force with regard to the search for a
single method of integration, invariably applicable to all cases. "It
is," says Lagrange, "one of those problems whose general solution we
cannot hope for." The more we meditate on this subject, the more we
will be convinced that such a research is utterly chimerical, as being
far above the feeble reach of our intelligence; although the labours of
geometers must certainly augment hereafter the amount of our knowledge
respecting integration, and thus create methods of greater generality.
The transcendental analysis is still too near its origin--there is
especially too little time since it has been conceived in a truly
rational manner--for us now to be able to have a correct idea of what it
will hereafter become. But, whatever should be our legitimate hopes, let
us not forget to consider, before all, the limits which are imposed by
our intellectual constitution, and which, though not susceptible of a
precise determination, have none the less an incontestable reality.

I am induced to think that, when geometers shall have exhausted the most
important applications of our present transcendental analysis, instead
of striving to impress upon it, as now conceived, a chimerical
perfection, they will rather create new resources by changing the mode
of derivation of the auxiliary quantities introduced in order to
facilitate the establishment of equations, and the formation of which
might follow an infinity of other laws besides the very simple relation
which has been chosen, according to the conception suggested in the
first chapter. The resources of this nature appear to me susceptible of
a much greater fecundity than those which would consist of merely
pushing farther our present calculus of indirect functions. It is a
suggestion which I submit to the geometers who have turned their
thoughts towards the general philosophy of analysis.

Finally, although, in the summary exposition which was the object of
this chapter, I have had to exhibit the condition of extreme
imperfection which still belongs to the integral calculus, the student
would have a false idea of the general resources of the transcendental
analysis if he gave that consideration too great an importance. It is
with it, indeed, as with ordinary analysis, in which a very small amount
of fundamental knowledge respecting the resolution of equations has been
employed with an immense degree of utility. Little advanced as geometers
really are as yet in the science of integrations, they have nevertheless
obtained, from their scanty abstract conceptions, the solution of a
multitude of questions of the first importance in geometry, in
mechanics, in thermology, &c. The philosophical explanation of this
double general fact results from the necessarily preponderating
importance and grasp of _abstract_ branches of knowledge, the least of
which is naturally found to correspond to a crowd of _concrete_
researches, man having no other resource for the successive extension of
his intellectual means than in the consideration of ideas more and more
abstract, and still positive.

       *       *       *       *       *

In order to finish the complete exposition of the philosophical
character of the transcendental analysis, there remains to be considered
a final conception, by which the immortal Lagrange has rendered this
analysis still better adapted to facilitate the establishment of
equations in the most difficult problems, by considering a class of
equations still more _indirect_ than the ordinary differential
equations. It is the _Calculus_, or, rather, the _Method of Variations_;
the general appreciation of which will be our next subject.




CHAPTER V.

THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS.


In order to grasp with more ease the philosophical character of the
_Method of Variations_, it will be well to begin by considering in a
summary manner the special nature of the problems, the general
resolution of which has rendered necessary the formation of this
hyper-transcendental analysis. It is still too near its origin, and its
applications have been too few, to allow us to obtain a sufficiently
clear general idea of it from a purely abstract exposition of its
fundamental theory.




PROBLEMS GIVING RISE TO IT.


The mathematical questions which have given birth to the _Calculus of
Variations_ consist generally in the investigation of the _maxima_ and
_minima_ of certain indeterminate integral formulas, which express the
analytical law of such or such a phenomenon of geometry or mechanics,
considered independently of any particular subject. Geometers for a long
time designated all the questions of this character by the common name
of _Isoperimetrical Problems_, which, however, is really suitable to
only the smallest number of them.


_Ordinary Questions of Maxima and Minima._ In the common theory of
_maxima_ and _minima_, it is proposed to discover, with reference to a
given function of one or more variables, what particular values must be
assigned to these variables, in order that the corresponding value of
the proposed function may be a _maximum_ or a _minimum_ with respect to
those values which immediately precede and follow it; that is, properly
speaking, we seek to know at what instant the function ceases to
increase and commences to decrease, or reciprocally. The differential
calculus is perfectly sufficient, as we know, for the general resolution
of this class of questions, by showing that the values of the different
variables, which suit either the maximum or minimum, must always reduce
to zero the different first derivatives of the given function, taken
separately with reference to each independent variable, and by
indicating, moreover, a suitable characteristic for distinguishing the
maximum from the minimum; consisting, in the case of a function of a
single variable, for example, in the derived function of the second
order taking a negative value for the maximum, and a positive value for
the minimum. Such are the well-known fundamental conditions belonging to
the greatest number of cases.


_A new Class of Questions._ The construction of this general theory
having necessarily destroyed the chief interest which questions of this
kind had for geometers, they almost immediately rose to the
consideration of a new order of problems, at once much more important
and of much greater difficulty--those of _isoperimeters_. It is, then,
no longer _the values of the variables_ belonging to the maximum or the
minimum of a given function that it is required to determine. It is _the
form of the function itself_ which is required to be discovered, from
the condition of the maximum or of the minimum of a certain definite
integral, merely indicated, which depends upon that function.


_Solid of least Resistance._ The oldest question of this nature is that
of _the solid of least resistance_, treated by Newton in the second book
of the Principia, in which he determines what ought to be the meridian
curve of a solid of revolution, in order that the resistance experienced
by that body in the direction of its axis may be the least possible. But
the course pursued by Newton, from the nature of his special method of
transcendental analysis, had not a character sufficiently simple,
sufficiently general, and especially sufficiently analytical, to attract
geometers to this new order of problems. To effect this, the application
of the infinitesimal method was needed; and this was done, in 1695, by
John Bernouilli, in proposing the celebrated problem of the
_Brachystochrone_.

This problem, which afterwards suggested such a long series of analogous
questions, consists in determining the curve which a heavy body must
follow in order to descend from one point to another in the shortest
possible time. Limiting the conditions to the simple fall in a vacuum,
the only case which was at first considered, it is easily found that the
required curve must be a reversed cycloid with a horizontal base, and
with its origin at the highest point. But the question may become
singularly complicated, either by taking into account the resistance of
the medium, or the change in the intensity of gravity.


_Isoperimeters._ Although this new class of problems was in the first
place furnished by mechanics, it is in geometry that the principal
investigations of this character were subsequently made. Thus it was
proposed to discover which, among all the curves of the same contour
traced between two given points, is that whose area is a maximum or
minimum, whence has come the name of _Problem of Isoperimeters_; or it
was required that the maximum or minimum should belong to the surface
produced by the revolution of the required curve about an axis, or to
the corresponding volume; in other cases, it was the vertical height of
the center of gravity of the unknown curve, or of the surface and of the
volume which it might generate, which was to become a maximum or
minimum, &c. Finally, these problems were varied and complicated almost
to infinity by the Bernouillis, by Taylor, and especially by Euler,
before Lagrange reduced their solution to an abstract and entirely
general method, the discovery of which has put a stop to the enthusiasm
of geometers for such an order of inquiries. This is not the place for
tracing the history of this subject. I have only enumerated some of the
simplest principal questions, in order to render apparent the original
general object of the method of variations.


_Analytical Nature of these Problems._ We see that all these problems,
considered in an analytical point of view, consist, by their nature, in
determining what form a certain unknown function of one or more
variables ought to have, in order that such or such an integral,
dependent upon that function, shall have, within assigned limits, a
value which is a maximum or a minimum with respect to all those which it
would take if the required function had any other form whatever.

Thus, for example, in the problem of the _brachystochrone_, it is well
known that if _y_ = _f(z)_, _x_ = π(_z_), are the rectilinear equations
of the required curve, supposing the axes of _x_ and of _y_ to be
horizontal, and the axis of _z_ to be vertical, the time of the fall of
a heavy body in that curve from the point whose ordinate is _z₁_, to
that whose ordinate is _z₂_, is expressed in general terms by the
definite integral

  ∫_{_z₂_}^{_z₁_}√(1 + (_f'(z))²_ + (π'(_z_))²/(2_gz_))_dz._

It is, then, necessary to find what the two unknown functions _f_ and π
must be, in order that this integral may be a minimum.

In the same way, to demand what is the curve among all plane
isoperimetrical curves, which includes the greatest area, is the same
thing as to propose to find, among all the functions _f(x)_ which can
give a certain constant value to the integral

  ∫_dx_√(1 + (_f'(x)_ )²),

that one which renders the integral ∫_f(x)dx_, taken between the same
limits, a maximum. It is evidently always so in other questions of this
class.


_Methods of the older Geometers._ In the solutions which geometers
before Lagrange gave of these problems, they proposed, in substance, to
reduce them to the ordinary theory of maxima and minima. But the means
employed to effect this transformation consisted in special simple
artifices peculiar to each case, and the discovery of which did not
admit of invariable and certain rules, so that every really new question
constantly reproduced analogous difficulties, without the solutions
previously obtained being really of any essential aid, otherwise than by
their discipline and training of the mind. In a word, this branch of
mathematics presented, then, the necessary imperfection which always
exists when the part common to all questions of the same class has not
yet been distinctly grasped in order to be treated in an abstract and
thenceforth general manner.




METHOD OF LAGRANGE.


Lagrange, in endeavouring to bring all the different problems of
isoperimeters to depend upon a common analysis, organized into a
distinct calculus, was led to conceive a new kind of differentiation, to
which he has applied the characteristic δ, reserving the characteristic
_d_ for the common differentials. These differentials of a new species,
which he has designated under the name of _Variations_, consist of the
infinitely small increments which the integrals receive, not by virtue
of analogous increments on the part of the corresponding variables, as
in the ordinary transcendental analysis, but by supposing that the
_form_ of the function placed under the sign of integration undergoes an
infinitely small change. This distinction is easily conceived with
reference to curves, in which we see the ordinate, or any other variable
of the curve, admit of two sorts of differentials, evidently very
different, according as we pass from one point to another infinitely
near it on the same curve, or to the corresponding point of the
infinitely near curve produced by a certain determinate modification of
the first curve.[11] It is moreover clear, that the relative
_variations_ of different magnitudes connected with each other by any
laws whatever are calculated, all but the characteristic, almost exactly
in the same manner as the differentials. Finally, from the general
notion of _variations_ are in like manner deduced the fundamental
principles of the algorithm proper to this method, consisting simply in
the evidently permissible liberty of transposing at will the
characteristics specially appropriated to variations, before or after
those which correspond to the ordinary differentials.

  [Footnote 11: Leibnitz had already considered the comparison of one
  curve with an other infinitely near to it, calling it
  "_Differentiatio de curva in curvam_." But this comparison had no
  analogy with the conception of Lagrange, the curves of Leibnitz
  being embraced in the same general equation, from which they were
  deduced by the simple change of an arbitrary constant.]

This abstract conception having been once formed, Lagrange was able to
reduce with ease, and in the most general manner, all the problems of
_Isoperimeters_ to the simple ordinary theory of _maxima_ and _minima_.
To obtain a clear idea of this great and happy transformation, we must
previously consider an essential distinction which arises in the
different questions of isoperimeters.


_Two Classes of Questions._ These investigations must, in fact, be
divided into two general classes, according as the maxima and minima
demanded are _absolute_ or _relative_, to employ the abridged
expressions of geometers.


_Questions of the first Class._ The _first case_ is that in which the
indeterminate definite integrals, the maximum or minimum of which is
sought, are not subjected, by the nature of the problem, to any
condition; as happens, for example, in the problem of the
_brachystochrone_, in which the choice is to be made between all
imaginable curves. The _second_ case takes place when, on the contrary,
the variable integrals can vary only according to certain conditions,
which usually consist in other definite integrals (which depend, in like
manner, upon the required functions) always retaining the same given
value; as, for example, in all the geometrical questions relating to
real _isoperimetrical_ figures, and in which, by the nature of the
problem, the integral relating to the length of the curve, or to the
area of the surface, must remain constant during the variation of that
integral which is the object of the proposed investigation.

The _Calculus of Variations_ gives immediately the general solution of
questions of the former class; for it evidently follows, from the
ordinary theory of maxima and minima, that the required relation must
reduce to zero the _variation_ of the proposed integral with reference
to each independent variable; which gives the condition common to both
the maximum and the minimum: and, as a characteristic for distinguishing
the one from the other, that the variation of the second order of the
same integral must be negative for the maximum and positive for the
minimum. Thus, for example, in the problem of the brachystochrone, we
will have, in order to determine the nature of the curve sought, the
equation of condition

  δ∫_{_z₂_}^{_z₁_}√([1 + (_f'(z)_)² + (π'(_z_))²]/(2_gz_))_dz_ = 0,

which, being decomposed into two, with respect to the two unknown
functions _f_ and π, which are independent of each other, will
completely express the analytical definition of the required curve. The
only difficulty peculiar to this new analysis consists in the
elimination of the characteristic δ, for which the calculus of
variations furnishes invariable and complete rules, founded, in general,
on the method of "integration by parts," from which Lagrange has thus
derived immense advantage. The constant object of this first analytical
elaboration (which this is not the place for treating in detail) is to
arrive at real differential equations, which can always be done; and
thereby the question comes under the ordinary transcendental analysis,
which furnishes the solution, at least so far as to reduce it to pure
algebra if the integration can be effected. The general object of the
method of variations is to effect this transformation, for which
Lagrange has established rules, which are simple, invariable, and
certain of success.


_Equations of Limits._ Among the greatest special advantages of the
method of variations, compared with the previous isolated solutions of
isoperimetrical problems, is the important consideration of what
Lagrange calls _Equations of Limits_, which were entirely neglected
before him, though without them the greater part of the particular
solutions remained necessarily incomplete. When the limits of the
proposed integrals are to be fixed, their variations being zero, there
is no occasion for noticing them. But it is no longer so when these
limits, instead of being rigorously invariable, are only subjected to
certain conditions; as, for example, if the two points between which the
required curve is to be traced are not fixed, and have only to remain
upon given lines or surfaces. Then it is necessary to pay attention to
the variation of their co-ordinates, and to establish between them the
relations which correspond to the equations of these lines or of these
surfaces.


_A more general consideration._ This essential consideration is only the
final complement of a more general and more important consideration
relative to the variations of different independent variables. If these
variables are really independent of one another, as when we compare
together all the imaginable curves susceptible of being traced between
two points, it will be the same with their variations, and,
consequently, the terms relating to each of these variations will have
to be separately equal to zero in the general equation which expresses
the maximum or the minimum. But if, on the contrary, we suppose the
variables to be subjected to any fixed conditions, it will be necessary
to take notice of the resulting relation between their variations, so
that the number of the equations into which this general equation is
then decomposed is always equal to only the number of the variables
which remain truly independent. It is thus, for example, that instead of
seeking for the shortest path between any two points, in choosing it
from among all possible ones, it may be proposed to find only what is
the shortest among all those which may be taken on any given surface; a
question the general solution of which forms certainly one of the most
beautiful applications of the method of variations.

_Questions of the second Class._ Problems in which such modifying
conditions are considered approach very nearly, in their nature, to the
second general class of applications of the method of variations,
characterized above as consisting in the investigation of _relative_
maxima and minima. There is, however, this essential difference between
the two cases, that in this last the modification is expressed by an
integral which depends upon the function sought, while in the other it
is designated by a finite equation which is immediately given. It is
hence apparent that the investigation of _relative_ maxima and minima is
constantly and necessarily more complicated than that of _absolute_
maxima and minima. Luckily, a very important general theory, discovered
by the genius of the great Euler before the invention of the Calculus of
Variations, gives a uniform and very simple means of making one of
these two classes of questions dependent on the other. It consists in
this, that if we add to the integral which is to be a maximum or a
minimum, a constant and indeterminate multiple of that one which, by the
nature of the problem, is to remain constant, it will be sufficient to
seek, by the general method of Lagrange above indicated, the _absolute_
maximum or minimum of this whole expression. It can be easily conceived,
indeed, that the part of the complete variation which would proceed from
the last integral must be equal to zero (because of the constant
character of this last) as well as the portion due to the first
integral, which disappears by virtue of the maximum or minimum state.
These two conditions evidently unite to produce, in that respect,
effects exactly alike.

Such is a sketch of the general manner in which the method of variation
is applied to all the different questions which compose what is called
the _Theory of Isoperimeters_. It will undoubtedly have been remarked in
this summary exposition how much use has been made in this new analysis
of the second fundamental property of the transcendental analysis
noticed in the third chapter, namely, the generality of the
infinitesimal expressions for the representation of the same geometrical
or mechanical phenomenon, in whatever body it may be considered. Upon
this generality, indeed, are founded, by their nature, all the solutions
due to the method of variations. If a single formula could not express
the length or the area of any curve whatever; if another fixed formula
could not designate the time of the fall of a heavy body, according to
whatever line it may descend, &c., how would it have been possible to
resolve questions which unavoidably require, by their nature, the
simultaneous consideration of all the cases which can be determined in
each phenomenon by the different subjects which exhibit it.


_Other Applications of this Method._ Notwithstanding the extreme
importance of the theory of isoperimeters, and though the method of
variations had at first no other object than the logical and general
solution of this order of problems, we should still have but an
incomplete idea of this beautiful analysis if we limited its destination
to this. In fact, the abstract conception of two distinct natures of
differentiation is evidently applicable not only to the cases for which
it was created, but also to all those which present, for any reason
whatever, two different manners of making the same magnitudes vary. It
is in this way that Lagrange himself has made, in his "_Méchanique
Analytique_," an extensive and important application of his calculus of
variations, by employing it to distinguish the two sorts of changes
which are naturally presented by the questions of rational mechanics for
the different points which are considered, according as we compare the
successive positions which are occupied, in virtue of its motion, by the
same point of each body in two consecutive instants, or as we pass from
one point of the body to another in the same instant. One of these
comparisons produces ordinary differentials; the other gives rise to
_variations_, which, there as every where, are only differentials taken
under a new point of view. Such is the general acceptation in which we
should conceive the Calculus of Variations, in order suitably to
appreciate the importance of this admirable logical instrument, the
most powerful that the human mind has as yet constructed.

The method of variations being only an immense extension of the general
transcendental analysis, I have no need of proving specially that it is
susceptible of being considered under the different fundamental points
of view which the calculus of indirect functions, considered as a whole,
admits of. Lagrange invented the Calculus of Variations in accordance
with the infinitesimal conception, and, indeed, long before he undertook
the general reconstruction of the transcendental analysis. When he had
executed this important reformation, he easily showed how it could also
be applied to the Calculus of Variations, which he expounded with all
the proper development, according to his theory of derivative functions.
But the more that the use of the method of variations is difficult of
comprehension, because of the higher degree of abstraction of the ideas
considered, the more necessary is it, in its application, to economize
the exertions of the mind, by adopting the most direct and rapid
analytical conception, namely, that of Leibnitz. Accordingly, Lagrange
himself has constantly preferred it in the important use which he has
made of the Calculus of Variations in his "Analytical Mechanics." In
fact, there does not exist the least hesitation in this respect among
geometers.




ITS RELATIONS TO THE ORDINARY CALCULUS.


In order to make as clear as possible the philosophical character of the
Calculus of Variations, I think that I should, in conclusion, briefly
indicate a consideration which seems to me important, and by which I can
approach it to the ordinary transcendental analysis in a higher degree
than Lagrange seems to me to have done.[12]

  [Footnote 12: I propose hereafter to develop this new
  consideration, in a special work upon the _Calculus of Variations_,
  intended to present this hyper-transcendental analysis in a new
  point of view, which I think adapted to extend its general range.]

We noticed in the preceding chapter the formation of the _calculus of
partial differences_, created by D'Alembert, as having introduced into
the transcendental analysis a new elementary idea; the notion of two
kinds of increments, distinct and independent of one another, which a
function of two variables may receive by virtue of the change of each
variable separately. It is thus that the vertical ordinate of a surface,
or any other magnitude which is referred to it, varies in two manners
which are quite distinct, and which may follow the most different laws,
according as we increase either the one or the other of the two
horizontal co-ordinates. Now such a consideration seems to me very
nearly allied, by its nature, to that which serves as the general basis
of the method of variations. This last, indeed, has in reality done
nothing but transfer to the independent variables themselves the
peculiar conception which had been already adopted for the functions of
these variables; a modification which has remarkably enlarged its use. I
think, therefore, that so far as regards merely the fundamental
conceptions, we may consider the calculus created by D'Alembert as
having established a natural and necessary transition between the
ordinary infinitesimal calculus and the calculus of variations; such a
derivation of which seems to be adapted to make the general notion more
clear and simple.

According to the different considerations indicated in this chapter, the
method of variations presents itself as the highest degree of perfection
which the analysis of indirect functions has yet attained. In its
primitive state, this last analysis presented itself as a powerful
general means of facilitating the mathematical study of natural
phenomena, by introducing, for the expression of their laws, the
consideration of auxiliary magnitudes, chosen in such a manner that
their relations are necessarily more simple and more easy to obtain than
those of the direct magnitudes. But the formation of these differential
equations was not supposed to admit of any general and abstract rules.
Now the Analysis of Variations, considered in the most philosophical
point of view, may be regarded as essentially destined, by its nature,
to bring within the reach of the calculus the actual establishment of
the differential equations; for, in a great number of important and
difficult questions, such is the general effect of the _varied_
equations, which, still more _indirect_ than the simple differential
equations with respect to the special objects of the investigation, are
also much more easy to form, and from which we may then, by invariable
and complete analytical methods, the object of which is to eliminate the
new order of auxiliary infinitesimals which have been introduced, deduce
those ordinary differential equations which it would often have been
impossible to establish directly. The method of variations forms, then,
the most sublime part of that vast system of mathematical analysis,
which, setting out from the most simple elements of algebra, organizes,
by an uninterrupted succession of ideas, general methods more and more
powerful, for the study of natural philosophy, and which, in its whole,
presents the most incomparably imposing and unequivocal monument of the
power of the human intellect.

We must, however, also admit that the conceptions which are habitually
considered in the method of variations being, by their nature, more
indirect, more general, and especially more abstract than all others,
the employment of such a method exacts necessarily and continuously the
highest known degree of intellectual exertion, in order never to lose
sight of the precise object of the investigation, in following
reasonings which offer to the mind such uncertain resting-places, and in
which signs are of scarcely any assistance. We must undoubtedly
attribute in a great degree to this difficulty the little real use which
geometers, with the exception of Lagrange, have as yet made of such an
admirable conception.




CHAPTER VI.

THE CALCULUS OF FINITE DIFFERENCES.


The different fundamental considerations indicated in the five preceding
chapters constitute, in reality, all the essential bases of a complete
exposition of mathematical analysis, regarded in the philosophical point
of view. Nevertheless, in order not to neglect any truly important
general conception relating to this analysis, I think that I should here
very summarily explain the veritable character of a kind of calculus
which is very extended, and which, though at bottom it really belongs to
ordinary analysis, is still regarded as being of an essentially distinct
nature. I refer to the _Calculus of Finite Differences_, which will be
the special subject of this chapter.


_Its general Character._ This calculus, created by Taylor, in his
celebrated work entitled _Methodus Incrementorum_, consists essentially
in the consideration of the finite increments which functions receive as
a consequence of analogous increments on the part of the corresponding
variables. These increments or _differences_, which take the
characteristic Δ, to distinguish them from _differentials_, or
infinitely small increments, may be in their turn regarded as new
functions, and become the subject of a second similar consideration, and
so on; from which results the notion of differences of various
successive orders, analogous, at least in appearance, to the consecutive
orders of differentials. Such a calculus evidently presents, like the
calculus of indirect functions, two general classes of questions:

1°. To determine the successive differences of all the various
analytical functions of one or more variables, as the result of a
definite manner of increase of the independent variables, which are
generally supposed to augment in arithmetical progression.

2°. Reciprocally, to start from these differences, or, more generally,
from any equations established between them, and go back to the
primitive functions themselves, or to their corresponding relations.

Hence follows the decomposition of this calculus into two distinct ones,
to which are usually given the names of the _Direct_, and the _Inverse
Calculus of Finite Differences_, the latter being also sometimes called
the _Integral Calculus of Finite Differences_. Each of these would,
also, evidently admit of a logical distribution similar to that given in
the fourth chapter for the differential and the integral calculus.


_Its true Nature._ There is no doubt that Taylor thought that by such a
conception he had founded a calculus of an entirely new nature,
absolutely distinct from ordinary analysis, and more general than the
calculus of Leibnitz, although resting on an analogous consideration. It
is in this way, also, that almost all geometers have viewed the analysis
of Taylor; but Lagrange, with his usual profundity, clearly perceived
that these properties belonged much more to the forms and to the
notations employed by Taylor than to the substance of his theory. In
fact, that which constitutes the peculiar character of the analysis of
Leibnitz, and makes of it a truly distinct and superior calculus, is the
circumstance that the derived functions are in general of an entirely
different nature from the primitive functions, so that they may give
rise to more simple and more easily formed relations: whence result the
admirable fundamental properties of the transcendental analysis, which
have been already explained. But it is not so with the _differences_
considered by Taylor; for these differences are, by their nature,
functions essentially similar to those which have produced them, a
circumstance which renders them unsuitable to facilitate the
establishment of equations, and prevents their leading to more general
relations. Every equation of finite differences is truly, at bottom, an
equation directly relating to the very magnitudes whose successive
states are compared. The scaffolding of new signs, which produce an
illusion respecting the true character of these equations, disguises it,
however, in a very imperfect manner, since it could always be easily
made apparent by replacing the _differences_ by the equivalent
combinations of the primitive magnitudes, of which they are really only
the abridged designations. Thus the calculus of Taylor never has
offered, and never can offer, in any question of geometry or of
mechanics, that powerful general aid which we have seen to result
necessarily from the analysis of Leibnitz. Lagrange has, moreover, very
clearly proven that the pretended analogy observed between the calculus
of differences and the infinitesimal calculus was radically vicious, in
this way, that the formulas belonging to the former calculus can never
furnish, as particular cases, those which belong to the latter, the
nature of which is essentially distinct.

From these considerations I am led to think that the calculus of finite
differences is, in general, improperly classed with the transcendental
analysis proper, that is, with the calculus of indirect functions. I
consider it, on the contrary, in accordance with the views of Lagrange,
to be only a very extensive and very important branch of ordinary
analysis, that is to say, of that which I have named the calculus of
direct functions, the equations which it considers being always, in
spite of the notation, simple _direct_ equations.




GENERAL THEORY OF SERIES.


To sum up as briefly as possible the preceding explanation, the calculus
of Taylor ought to be regarded as having constantly for its true object
the general theory of _Series_, the most simple cases of which had alone
been considered before that illustrious geometer. I ought, properly, to
have mentioned this important theory in treating, in the second chapter,
of Algebra proper, of which it is such an extensive branch. But, in
order to avoid a double reference to it, I have preferred to notice it
only in the consideration of the calculus of finite differences, which,
reduced to its most simple general expression, is nothing but a complete
logical study of questions relating to _series_.

Every _Series_, or succession of numbers deduced from one another
according to any constant law, necessarily gives rise to these two
fundamental questions:

1°. The law of the series being supposed known, to find the expression
for its general term, so as to be able to calculate immediately any term
whatever without being obliged to form successively all the preceding
terms.

2°. In the same circumstances, to determine the _sum_ of any number of
terms of the series by means of their places, so that it can be known
without the necessity of continually adding these terms together.

These two fundamental questions being considered to be resolved, it may
be proposed, reciprocally, to find the law of a series from the form of
its general term, or the expression of the sum. Each of these different
problems has so much the more extent and difficulty, as there can be
conceived a greater number of different _laws_ for the series, according
to the number of preceding terms on which each term directly depends,
and according to the function which expresses that dependence. We may
even consider series with several variable indices, as Laplace has done
in his "Analytical Theory of Probabilities," by the analysis to which he
has given the name of _Theory of Generating Functions_, although it is
really only a new and higher branch of the calculus of finite
differences or of the general theory of series.

These general views which I have indicated give only an imperfect idea
of the truly infinite extent and variety of the questions to which
geometers have risen by means of this single consideration of series, so
simple in appearance and so limited in its origin. It necessarily
presents as many different cases as the algebraic resolution of
equations, considered in its whole extent; and it is, by its nature,
much more complicated, so much, indeed, that it always needs this last
to conduct it to a complete solution. We may, therefore, anticipate what
must still be its extreme imperfection, in spite of the successive
labours of several geometers of the first order. We do not, indeed,
possess as yet the complete and logical solution of any but the most
simple questions of this nature.


_Its identity with this Calculus._ It is now easy to conceive the
necessary and perfect identity, which has been already announced,
between the calculus of finite differences and the theory of series
considered in all its bearings. In fact, every differentiation after the
manner of Taylor evidently amounts to finding the _law_ of formation of
a series with one or with several variable indices, from the expression
of its general term; in the same way, every analogous integration may be
regarded as having for its object the summation of a series, the general
term of which would be expressed by the proposed difference. In this
point of view, the various problems of the calculus of differences,
direct or inverse, resolved by Taylor and his successors, have really a
very great value, as treating of important questions relating to series.
But it is very doubtful if the form and the notation introduced by
Taylor really give any essential facility in the solution of questions
of this kind. It would be, perhaps, more advantageous for most cases,
and certainly more logical, to replace the _differences_ by the terms
themselves, certain combinations of which they represent. As the
calculus of Taylor does not rest on a truly distinct fundamental idea,
and has nothing peculiar to it but its system of signs, there could
never really be any important advantage in considering it as detached
from ordinary analysis, of which it is, in reality, only an immense
branch. This consideration of _differences_, most generally useless,
even if it does not cause complication, seems to me to retain the
character of an epoch in which, analytical ideas not being sufficiently
familiar to geometers, they were naturally led to prefer the special
forms suitable for simple numerical comparisons.




PERIODIC OR DISCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS.


However that may be, I must not finish this general appreciation of the
calculus of finite differences without noticing a new conception to
which it has given birth, and which has since acquired a great
importance. It is the consideration of those periodic or discontinuous
functions which preserve the same value for an infinite series of values
of the corresponding variables, subjected to a certain law, and which
must be necessarily added to the integrals of the equations of finite
differences in order to render them sufficiently general, as simple
arbitrary constants are added to all quadratures in order to complete
their generality. This idea, primitively introduced by Euler, has since
been the subject of extended investigation by M. Fourier, who has made
new and important applications of it in his mathematical theory of heat.




APPLICATIONS OF THIS CALCULUS.


_Series._ Among the principal general applications which have been made
of the calculus of finite differences, it would be proper to place in
the first rank, as the most extended and the most important, the
solution of questions relating to series; if, as has been shown, the
general theory of series ought not to be considered as constituting, by
its nature, the actual foundation of the calculus of Taylor.


_Interpolations._ This great class of problems being then set aside, the
most essential of the veritable applications of the analysis of Taylor
is, undoubtedly, thus far, the general method of _interpolations_, so
frequently and so usefully employed in the investigation of the
empirical laws of natural phenomena. The question consists, as is well
known, in intercalating between certain given numbers other intermediate
numbers, subjected to the same law which we suppose to exist between the
first. We can abundantly verify, in this principal application of the
calculus of Taylor, how truly foreign and often inconvenient is the
consideration of _differences_ with respect to the questions which
depend on that analysis. Indeed, Lagrange has replaced the formulas of
interpolation, deduced from the ordinary algorithm of the calculus of
finite differences, by much simpler general formulas, which are now
almost always preferred, and which have been found directly, without
making any use of the notion of _differences_, which only complicates
the question.


_Approximate Rectification, &c._ A last important class of applications
of the calculus of finite differences, which deserves to be
distinguished from the preceding, consists in the eminently useful
employment made of it in geometry for determining by approximation the
length and the area of any curve, and in the same way the cubature of a
body of any form whatever. This procedure (which may besides be
conceived abstractly as depending on the same analytical investigation
as the question of interpolation) frequently offers a valuable
supplement to the entirely logical geometrical methods which often lead
to integrations, which we do not yet know how to effect, or to
calculations of very complicated execution.

       *       *       *       *       *

Such are the various principal considerations to be noticed with respect
to the calculus of finite differences. This examination completes the
proposed philosophical outline of ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS.


CONCRETE MATHEMATICS will now be the subject of a similar labour. In it
we shall particularly devote ourselves to examining how it has been
possible (supposing the general science of the calculus to be perfect),
by invariable procedures, to reduce to pure questions of analysis all
the problems which can be presented by _Geometry_ and _Mechanics_, and
thus to impress on these two fundamental bases of natural philosophy a
degree of precision and especially of unity; in a word, a character of
high perfection, which could be communicated to them by such a course
alone.

CHAPTER I.

GENERAL VIEW OF GEOMETRY.


_Its true Nature._ After the general exposition of the philosophical
character of concrete mathematics, compared with that of abstract
mathematics, given in the introductory chapter, it need not here be
shown in a special manner that geometry must be considered as a true
natural science, only much more simple, and therefore much more perfect,
than any other. This necessary perfection of geometry, obtained
essentially by the application of mathematical analysis, which it so
eminently admits, is apt to produce erroneous views of the real nature
of this fundamental science, which most minds at present conceive to be
a purely logical science quite independent of observation. It is
nevertheless evident, to any one who examines with attention the
character of geometrical reasonings, even in the present state of
abstract geometry, that, although the facts which are considered in it
are much more closely united than those relating to any other science,
still there always exists, with respect to every body studied by
geometers, a certain number of primitive phenomena, which, since they
are not established by any reasoning, must be founded on observation
alone, and which form the necessary basis of all the deductions.

The scientific superiority of geometry arises from the phenomena which
it considers being necessarily the most universal and the most simple of
all. Not only may all the bodies of nature give rise to geometrical
inquiries, as well as mechanical ones, but still farther, geometrical
phenomena would still exist, even though all the parts of the universe
should be considered as immovable. Geometry is then, by its nature, more
general than mechanics. At the same time, its phenomena are more simple,
for they are evidently independent of mechanical phenomena, while these
latter are always complicated with the former. The same relations hold
good in comparing geometry with abstract thermology.

For these reasons, in our classification we have made geometry the first
part of concrete mathematics; that part the study of which, in addition
to its own importance, serves as the indispensable basis of all the
rest.

Before considering directly the philosophical study of the different
orders of inquiries which constitute our present geometry, we should
obtain a clear and exact idea of the general destination of that
science, viewed in all its bearings. Such is the object of this chapter.


_Definition._ Geometry is commonly defined in a very vague and entirely
improper manner, as being _the science of extension_. An improvement on
this would be to say that geometry has for its object the _measurement_
of extension; but such an explanation would be very insufficient,
although at bottom correct, and would be far from giving any idea of the
true general character of geometrical science.

To do this, I think that I should first explain _two fundamental ideas_,
which, very simple in themselves, have been singularly obscured by the
employment of metaphysical considerations.


_The Idea of Space._ The first is that of _Space_. This conception
properly consists simply in this, that, instead of considering extension
in the bodies themselves, we view it in an indefinite medium, which we
regard as containing all the bodies of the universe. This notion is
naturally suggested to us by observation, when we think of the
_impression_ which a body would leave in a fluid in which it had been
placed. It is clear, in fact, that, as regards its geometrical
relations, such an _impression_ may be substituted for the body itself,
without altering the reasonings respecting it. As to the physical nature
of this indefinite _space_, we are spontaneously led to represent it to
ourselves, as being entirely analogous to the actual medium in which we
live; so that if this medium was liquid instead of gaseous, our
geometrical _space_ would undoubtedly be conceived as liquid also. This
circumstance is, moreover, only very secondary, the essential object of
such a conception being only to make us view extension separately from
the bodies which manifest it to us. We can easily understand in advance
the importance of this fundamental image, since it permits us to study
geometrical phenomena in themselves, abstraction being made of all the
other phenomena which constantly accompany them in real bodies, without,
however, exerting any influence over them. The regular establishment of
this general abstraction must be regarded as the first step which has
been made in the rational study of geometry, which would have been
impossible if it had been necessary to consider, together with the form
and the magnitude of bodies, all their other physical properties. The
use of such an hypothesis, which is perhaps the most ancient
philosophical conception created by the human mind, has now become so
familiar to us, that we have difficulty in exactly estimating its
importance, by trying to appreciate the consequences which would result
from its suppression.


_Different Kinds of Extension._ The second preliminary geometrical
conception which we have to examine is that of the different kinds of
extension, designated by the words _volume_, _surface_, _line_, and even
_point_, and of which the ordinary explanation is so unsatisfactory.[13]

  [Footnote 13: Lacroix has justly criticised the expression of
  _solid_, commonly used by geometers to designate a _volume_. It is
  certain, in fact, that when we wish to consider separately a
  certain portion of indefinite space, conceived as gaseous, we
  mentally solidify its exterior envelope, so that a _line_ and a
  _surface_ are habitually, to our minds, just as _solid_ as a
  _volume_. It may also be remarked that most generally, in order
  that bodies may penetrate one another with more facility, we are
  obliged to imagine the interior of the _volumes_ to be hollow,
  which renders still more sensible the impropriety of the word
  _solid_.]

Although it is evidently impossible to conceive any extension absolutely
deprived of any one of the three fundamental dimensions, it is no less
incontestable that, in a great number of occasions, even of immediate
utility, geometrical questions depend on only two dimensions, considered
separately from the third, or on a single dimension, considered
separately from the two others. Again, independently of this direct
motive, the study of extension with a single dimension, and afterwards
with two, clearly presents itself as an indispensable preliminary for
facilitating the study of complete bodies of three dimensions, the
immediate theory of which would be too complicated. Such are the two
general motives which oblige geometers to consider separately extension
with regard to one or to two dimensions, as well as relatively to all
three together.

The general notions of _surface_ and of _line_ have been formed by the
human mind, in order that it may be able to think, in a permanent
manner, of extension in two directions, or in one only. The hyperbolical
expressions habitually employed by geometers to define these notions
tend to convey false ideas of them; but, examined in themselves, they
have no other object than to permit us to reason with facility
respecting these two kinds of extension, making complete abstraction of
that which ought not to be taken into consideration. Now for this it is
sufficient to conceive the dimension which we wish to eliminate as
becoming gradually smaller and smaller, the two others remaining the
same, until it arrives at such a degree of tenuity that it can no longer
fix the attention. It is thus that we naturally acquire the real idea of
a _surface_, and, by a second analogous operation, the idea of a _line_,
by repeating for breadth what we had at first done for thickness.
Finally, if we again repeat the same operation, we arrive at the idea of
a _point_, or of an extension considered only with reference to its
place, abstraction being made of all magnitude, and designed
consequently to determine positions.

_Surfaces_ evidently have, moreover, the general property of exactly
circumscribing volumes; and in the same way, _lines_, in their turn,
circumscribe _surfaces_ and are limited by _points_. But this
consideration, to which too much importance is often given, is only a
secondary one.

Surfaces and lines are, then, in reality, always conceived with three
dimensions; it would be, in fact, impossible to represent to one's self
a surface otherwise than as an extremely thin plate, and a line
otherwise than as an infinitely fine thread. It is even plain that the
degree of tenuity attributed by each individual to the dimensions of
which he wishes to make abstraction is not constantly identical, for it
must depend on the degree of subtilty of his habitual geometrical
observations. This want of uniformity has, besides, no real
inconvenience, since it is sufficient, in order that the ideas of
surface and of line should satisfy the essential condition of their
destination, for each one to represent to himself the dimensions which
are to be neglected as being smaller than all those whose magnitude his
daily experience gives him occasion to appreciate.

We hence see how devoid of all meaning are the fantastic discussions of
metaphysicians upon the foundations of geometry. It should also be
remarked that these primordial ideas are habitually presented by
geometers in an unphilosophical manner, since, for example, they explain
the notions of the different sorts of extent in an order absolutely the
inverse of their natural dependence, which often produces the most
serious inconveniences in elementary instruction.




THE FINAL OBJECT OF GEOMETRY.


These preliminaries being established, we can proceed directly to the
general definition of geometry, continuing to conceive this science as
having for its final object the _measurement_ of extension.

It is necessary in this matter to go into a thorough explanation,
founded on the distinction of the three kinds of extension, since the
notion of _measurement_ is not exactly the same with reference to
surfaces and volumes as to lines.


_Nature of Geometrical Measurement._ If we take the word _measurement_
in its direct and general mathematical acceptation, which signifies
simply the determination of the value of the _ratios_ between any
homogeneous magnitudes, we must consider, in geometry, that the
_measurement_ of surfaces and of volumes, unlike that of lines, is never
conceived, even in the most simple and the most favourable cases, as
being effected directly. The comparison of two lines is regarded as
direct; that of two surfaces or of two volumes is, on the contrary,
always indirect. Thus we conceive that two lines may be superposed; but
the superposition of two surfaces, or, still more so, of two volumes, is
evidently impossible in most cases; and, even when it becomes rigorously
practicable, such a comparison is never either convenient or exact. It
is, then, very necessary to explain wherein properly consists the truly
geometrical measurement of a surface or of a volume.


_Measurement of Surfaces and of Volumes._ For this we must consider
that, whatever may be the form of a body, there always exists a certain
number of lines, more or less easy to be assigned, the length of which
is sufficient to define exactly the magnitude of its surface or of its
volume. Geometry, regarding these lines as alone susceptible of being
directly measured, proposes to deduce, from the simple determination of
them, the ratio of the surface or of the volume sought, to the unity of
surface, or to the unity of volume. Thus the general object of
geometry, with respect to surfaces and to volumes, is properly to reduce
all comparisons of surfaces or of volumes to simple comparisons of
lines.

Besides the very great facility which such a transformation evidently
offers for the measurement of volumes and of surfaces, there results
from it, in considering it in a more extended and more scientific
manner, the general possibility of reducing to questions of lines all
questions relating to volumes and to surfaces, considered with reference
to their magnitude. Such is often the most important use of the
geometrical expressions which determine surfaces and volumes in
functions of the corresponding lines.

It is true that direct comparisons between surfaces or between volumes
are sometimes employed; but such measurements are not regarded as
geometrical, but only as a supplement sometimes necessary, although too
rarely applicable, to the insufficiency or to the difficulty of truly
rational methods. It is thus that we often determine the volume of a
body, and in certain cases its surface, by means of its weight. In the
same way, on other occasions, when we can substitute for the proposed
volume an equivalent liquid volume, we establish directly the comparison
of the two volumes, by profiting by the property possessed by liquid
masses, of assuming any desired form. But all means of this nature are
purely mechanical, and rational geometry necessarily rejects them.

To render more sensible the difference between these modes of
determination and true geometrical measurements, I will cite a single
very remarkable example; the manner in which Galileo determined the
ratio of the ordinary cycloid to that of the generating circle. The
geometry of his time was as yet insufficient for the rational solution
of such a problem. Galileo conceived the idea of discovering that ratio
by a direct experiment. Having weighed as exactly as possible two plates
of the same material and of equal thickness, one of them having the form
of a circle and the other that of the generated cycloid, he found the
weight of the latter always triple that of the former; whence he
inferred that the area of the cycloid is triple that of the generating
circle, a result agreeing with the veritable solution subsequently
obtained by Pascal and Wallis. Such a success evidently depends on the
extreme simplicity of the ratio sought; and we can understand the
necessary insufficiency of such expedients, even when they are actually
practicable.

We see clearly, from what precedes, the nature of that part of geometry
relating to _volumes_ and that relating to _surfaces_. But the character
of the geometry of _lines_ is not so apparent, since, in order to
simplify the exposition, we have considered the measurement of lines as
being made directly. There is, therefore, needed a complementary
explanation with respect to them.


_Measurement of curved Lines._ For this purpose, it is sufficient to
distinguish between the right line and curved lines, the measurement of
the first being alone regarded as direct, and that of the other as
always indirect. Although superposition is sometimes strictly
practicable for curved lines, it is nevertheless evident that truly
rational geometry must necessarily reject it, as not admitting of any
precision, even when it is possible. The geometry of lines has, then,
for its general object, to reduce in every case the measurement of
curved lines to that of right lines; and consequently, in the most
extended point of view, to reduce to simple questions of right lines all
questions relating to the magnitude of any curves whatever. To
understand the possibility of such a transformation, we must remark,
that in every curve there always exist certain right lines, the length
of which must be sufficient to determine that of the curve. Thus, in a
circle, it is evident that from the length of the radius we must be able
to deduce that of the circumference; in the same way, the length of an
ellipse depends on that of its two axes; the length of a cycloid upon
the diameter of the generating circle, &c.; and if, instead of
considering the whole of each curve, we demand, more generally, the
length of any arc, it will be sufficient to add to the different
rectilinear parameters, which determine the whole curve, the chord of
the proposed arc, or the co-ordinates of its extremities. To discover
the relation which exists between the length of a curved line and that
of similar right lines, is the general problem of the part of geometry
which relates to the study of lines.

Combining this consideration with those previously suggested with
respect to volumes and to surfaces, we may form a very clear idea of the
science of geometry, conceived in all its parts, by assigning to it, for
its general object, the final reduction of the comparisons of all kinds
of extent, volumes, surfaces, or lines, to simple comparisons of right
lines, the only comparisons regarded as capable of being made directly,
and which indeed could not be reduced to any others more easy to effect.
Such a conception, at the same time, indicates clearly the veritable
character of geometry, and seems suited to show at a single glance its
utility and its perfection.


_Measurement of right Lines._ In order to complete this fundamental
explanation, I have yet to show how there can be, in geometry, a special
section relating to the right line, which seems at first incompatible
with the principle that the measurement of this class of lines must
always be regarded as direct.

It is so, in fact, as compared with that of curved lines, and of all the
other objects which geometry considers. But it is evident that the
estimation of a right line cannot be viewed as direct except so far as
the linear unit can be applied to it. Now this often presents
insurmountable difficulties, as I had occasion to show, for another
reason, in the introductory chapter. We must, then, make the measurement
of the proposed right line depend on other analogous measurements
capable of being effected directly. There is, then, necessarily a
primary distinct branch of geometry, exclusively devoted to the right
line; its object is to determine certain right lines from others by
means of the relations belonging to the figures resulting from their
assemblage. This preliminary part of geometry, which is almost
imperceptible in viewing the whole of the science, is nevertheless
susceptible of a great development. It is evidently of especial
importance, since all other geometrical measurements are referred to
those of right lines, and if they could not be determined, the solution
of every question would remain unfinished.

Such, then, are the various fundamental parts of rational geometry,
arranged according to their natural dependence; the geometry of _lines_
being first considered, beginning with the right line; then the geometry
of _surfaces_, and, finally, that of _solids_.




INFINITE EXTENT OF ITS FIELD.


Having determined with precision the general and final object of
geometrical inquiries, the science must now be considered with respect
to the field embraced by each of its three fundamental sections.

Thus considered, geometry is evidently susceptible, by its nature, of an
extension which is rigorously infinite; for the measurement of lines, of
surfaces, or of volumes presents necessarily as many distinct questions
as we can conceive different figures subjected to exact definitions; and
their number is evidently infinite.

Geometers limited themselves at first to consider the most simple
figures which were directly furnished them by nature, or which were
deduced from these primitive elements by the least complicated
combinations. But they have perceived, since Descartes, that, in order
to constitute the science in the most philosophical manner, it was
necessary to make it apply to all imaginable figures. This abstract
geometry will then inevitably comprehend as particular cases all the
different real figures which the exterior world could present. It is
then a fundamental principle in truly rational geometry to consider, as
far as possible, all figures which can be rigorously conceived.

The most superficial examination is enough to convince us that these
figures present a variety which is quite infinite.


_Infinity of Lines._ With respect to curved _lines_, regarding them as
generated by the motion of a point governed by a certain law, it is
plain that we shall have, in general, as many different curves as we
conceive different laws for this motion, which may evidently be
determined by an infinity of distinct conditions; although it may
sometimes accidentally happen that new generations produce curves which
have been already obtained. Thus, among plane curves, if a point moves
so as to remain constantly at the same distance from a fixed point, it
will generate a _circle_; if it is the sum or the difference of its
distances from two fixed points which remains constant, the curve
described will be an _ellipse_ or an _hyperbola_; if it is their
product, we shall have an entirely different curve; if the point departs
equally from a fixed point and from a fixed line, it will describe a
_parabola_; if it revolves on a circle at the same time that this circle
rolls along a straight line, we shall have a _cycloid_; if it advances
along a straight line, while this line, fixed at one of its extremities,
turns in any manner whatever, there will result what in general terms
are called _spirals_, which of themselves evidently present as many
perfectly distinct curves as we can suppose different relations between
these two motions of translation and of rotation, &c. Each of these
different curves may then furnish new ones, by the different general
constructions which geometers have imagined, and which give rise to
evolutes, to epicycloids, to caustics, &c. Finally, there exists a still
greater variety among curves of double curvature.


_Infinity of Surfaces._ As to _surfaces_, the figures are necessarily
more different still, considering them as generated by the motion of
lines. Indeed, the figure may then vary, not only in considering, as in
curves, the different infinitely numerous laws to which the motion of
the generating line may be subjected, but also in supposing that this
line itself may change its nature; a circumstance which has nothing
analogous in curves, since the points which describe them cannot have
any distinct figure. Two classes of very different conditions may then
cause the figures of surfaces to vary, while there exists only one for
lines. It is useless to cite examples of this doubly infinite
multiplicity of surfaces. It would be sufficient to consider the extreme
variety of the single group of surfaces which may be generated by a
right line, and which comprehends the whole family of cylindrical
surfaces, that of conical surfaces, the most general class of
developable surfaces, &c.


_Infinity of Volumes._ With respect to _volumes_, there is no occasion
for any special consideration, since they are distinguished from each
other only by the surfaces which bound them.

In order to complete this sketch, it should be added that surfaces
themselves furnish a new general means of conceiving new curves, since
every curve may be regarded as produced by the intersection of two
surfaces. It is in this way, indeed, that the first lines which we may
regard as having been truly invented by geometers were obtained, since
nature gave directly the straight line and the circle. We know that the
ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola, the only curves completely
studied by the ancients, were in their origin conceived only as
resulting from the intersection of a cone with circular base by a plane
in different positions. It is evident that, by the combined employment
of these different general means for the formation of lines and of
surfaces, we could produce a rigorously infinitely series of distinct
forms in starting from only a very small number of figures directly
furnished by observation.


_Analytical invention of Curves, &c._ Finally, all the various direct
means for the invention of figures have scarcely any farther importance,
since rational geometry has assumed its final character in the hands of
Descartes. Indeed, as we shall see more fully in chapter iii., the
invention of figures is now reduced to the invention of equations, so
that nothing is more easy than to conceive new lines and new surfaces,
by changing at will the functions introduced into the equations. This
simple abstract procedure is, in this respect, infinitely more fruitful
than all the direct resources of geometry, developed by the most
powerful imagination, which should devote itself exclusively to that
order of conceptions. It also explains, in the most general and the most
striking manner, the necessarily infinite variety of geometrical forms,
which thus corresponds to the diversity of analytical functions. Lastly,
it shows no less clearly that the different forms of surfaces must be
still more numerous than those of lines, since lines are represented
analytically by equations with two variables, while surfaces give rise
to equations with three variables, which necessarily present a greater
diversity.

The preceding considerations are sufficient to show clearly the
rigorously infinite extent of each of the three general sections of
geometry.




EXPANSION OF ORIGINAL DEFINITION.


To complete the formation of an exact and sufficiently extended idea of
the nature of geometrical inquiries, it is now indispensable to return
to the general definition above given, in order to present it under a
new point of view, without which the complete science would be only very
imperfectly conceived.

When we assign as the object of geometry the _measurement_ of all sorts
of lines, surfaces, and volumes, that is, as has been explained, the
reduction of all geometrical comparisons to simple comparisons of right
lines, we have evidently the advantage of indicating a general
destination very precise and very easy to comprehend. But if we set
aside every definition, and examine the actual composition of the
science of geometry, we will at first be induced to regard the preceding
definition as much too narrow; for it is certain that the greater part
of the investigations which constitute our present geometry do not at
all appear to have for their object the _measurement_ of extension. In
spite of this fundamental objection, I will persist in retaining this
definition; for, in fact, if, instead of confining ourselves to
considering the different questions of geometry isolatedly, we endeavour
to grasp the leading questions, in comparison with which all others,
however important they may be, must be regarded as only secondary, we
will finally recognize that the measurement of lines, of surfaces, and
of volumes, is the invariable object, sometimes _direct_, though most
often _indirect_, of all geometrical labours.

This general proposition being fundamental, since it can alone give our
definition all its value, it is indispensable to enter into some
developments upon this subject.




PROPERTIES OF LINES AND SURFACES.


When we examine with attention the geometrical investigations which do
not seem to relate to the _measurement_ of extent, we find that they
consist essentially in the study of the different _properties_ of each
line or of each surface; that is, in the knowledge of the different
modes of generation, or at least of definition, peculiar to each figure
considered. Now we can easily establish in the most general manner the
necessary relation of such a study to the question of _measurement_, for
which the most complete knowledge of the properties of each form is an
indispensable preliminary. This is concurrently proven by two
considerations, equally fundamental, although quite distinct in their
nature.


NECESSITY OF THEIR STUDY: 1. _To find the most suitable Property._ The
_first_, purely scientific, consists in remarking that, if we did not
know any other characteristic property of each line or surface than that
one according to which geometers had first conceived it, in most cases
it would be impossible to succeed in the solution of questions relating
to its _measurement_. In fact, it is easy to understand that the
different definitions which each figure admits of are not all equally
suitable for such an object, and that they even present the most
complete oppositions in that respect. Besides, since the primitive
definition of each figure was evidently not chosen with this condition
in view, it is clear that we must not expect, in general, to find it the
most suitable; whence results the necessity of discovering others, that
is, of studying as far as is possible the _properties_ of the proposed
figure. Let us suppose, for example, that the circle is defined to be
"the curve which, with the same contour, contains the greatest area."
This is certainly a very characteristic property, but we would evidently
find insurmountable difficulties in trying to deduce from such a
starting point the solution of the fundamental questions relating to the
rectification or to the quadrature of this curve. It is clear, in
advance, that the property of having all its points equally distant from
a fixed point must evidently be much better adapted to inquiries of this
nature, even though it be not precisely the most suitable. In like
manner, would Archimedes ever have been able to discover the quadrature
of the parabola if he had known no other property of that curve than
that it was the section of a cone with a circular base, by a plane
parallel to its generatrix? The purely speculative labours of preceding
geometers, in transforming this first definition, were evidently
indispensable preliminaries to the direct solution of such a question.
The same is true, in a still greater degree, with respect to surfaces.
To form a just idea of this, we need only compare, as to the question of
cubature or quadrature, the common definition of the sphere with that
one, no less characteristic certainly, which would consist in regarding
a spherical body, as that one which, with the same area, contains the
greatest volume.

No more examples are needed to show the necessity of knowing, so far as
is possible, all the properties of each line or of each surface, in
order to facilitate the investigation of rectifications, of quadratures,
and of cubatures, which constitutes the final object of geometry. We may
even say that the principal difficulty of questions of this kind
consists in employing in each case the property which is best adapted
to the nature of the proposed problem. Thus, while we continue to
indicate, for more precision, the measurement of extension as the
general destination of geometry, this first consideration, which goes to
the very bottom of the subject, shows clearly the necessity of including
in it the study, as thorough as possible, of the different generations
or definitions belonging to the same form.


2. _To pass from the Concrete to the Abstract._ A second consideration,
of at least equal importance, consists in such a study being
indispensable for organizing in a rational manner the relation of the
abstract to the concrete in geometry.

The science of geometry having to consider all imaginable figures which
admit of an exact definition, it necessarily results from this, as we
have remarked, that questions relating to any figures presented by
nature are always implicitly comprised in this abstract geometry,
supposed to have attained its perfection. But when it is necessary to
actually pass to concrete geometry, we constantly meet with a
fundamental difficulty, that of knowing to which of the different
abstract types we are to refer, with sufficient approximation, the real
lines or surfaces which we have to study. Now it is for the purpose of
establishing such a relation that it is particularly indispensable to
know the greatest possible number of properties of each figure
considered in geometry.

In fact, if we always confined ourselves to the single primitive
definition of a line or of a surface, supposing even that we could then
_measure_ it (which, according to the first order of considerations,
would generally be impossible), this knowledge would remain almost
necessarily barren in the application, since we should not ordinarily
know how to recognize that figure in nature when it presented itself
there; to ensure that, it would be necessary that the single
characteristic, according to which geometers had conceived it, should be
precisely that one whose verification external circumstances would
admit: a coincidence which would be purely fortuitous, and on which we
could not count, although it might sometimes take place. It is, then,
only by multiplying as much as possible the characteristic properties of
each abstract figure, that we can be assured, in advance, of recognizing
it in the concrete state, and of thus turning to account all our
rational labours, by verifying in each case the definition which is
susceptible of being directly proven. This definition is almost always
the only one in given circumstances, and varies, on the other hand, for
the same figure, with different circumstances; a double reason for its
previous determination.


_Illustration: Orbits of the Planets._ The geometry of the heavens
furnishes us with a very memorable example in this matter, well suited
to show the general necessity of such a study. We know that the ellipse
was discovered by Kepler to be the curve which the planets describe
about the sun, and the satellites about their planets. Now would this
fundamental discovery, which re-created astronomy, ever have been
possible, if geometers had been always confined to conceiving the
ellipse only as the oblique section of a circular cone by a plane? No
such definition, it is evident, would admit of such a verification. The
most general property of the ellipse, that the sum of the distances from
any of its points to two fixed points is a constant quantity, is
undoubtedly much more susceptible, by its nature, of causing the curve
to be recognized in this case, but still is not directly suitable. The
only characteristic which can here be immediately verified is that which
is derived from the relation which exists in the ellipse between the
length of the focal distances and their direction; the only relation
which admits of an astronomical interpretation, as expressing the law
which connects the distance from the planet to the sun, with the time
elapsed since the beginning of its revolution. It was, then, necessary
that the purely speculative labours of the Greek geometers on the
properties of the conic sections should have previously presented their
generation under a multitude of different points of view, before Kepler
could thus pass from the abstract to the concrete, in choosing from
among all these different characteristics that one which could be most
easily proven for the planetary orbits.


_Illustration: Figure of the Earth._ Another example of the same order,
but relating to surfaces, occurs in considering the important question
of the figure of the earth. If we had never known any other property of
the sphere than its primitive character of having all its points equally
distant from an interior point, how would we ever have been able to
discover that the surface of the earth was spherical? For this, it was
necessary previously to deduce from this definition of the sphere some
properties capable of being verified by observations made upon the
surface alone, such as the constant ratio which exists between the
length of the path traversed in the direction of any meridian of a
sphere going towards a pole, and the angular height of this pole above
the horizon at each point. Another example, but involving a much longer
series of preliminary speculations, is the subsequent proof that the
earth is not rigorously spherical, but that its form is that of an
ellipsoid of revolution.

After such examples, it would be needless to give any others, which any
one besides may easily multiply. All of them prove that, without a very
extended knowledge of the different properties of each figure, the
relation of the abstract to the concrete, in geometry, would be purely
accidental, and that the science would consequently want one of its most
essential foundations.

Such, then, are two general considerations which fully demonstrate the
necessity of introducing into geometry a great number of investigations
which have not the _measurement_ of extension for their direct object;
while we continue, however, to conceive such a measurement as being the
final destination of all geometrical science. In this way we can retain
the philosophical advantages of the clearness and precision of this
definition, and still include in it, in a very logical though indirect
manner, all known geometrical researches, in considering those which do
not seem to relate to the measurement of extension, as intended either
to prepare for the solution of the final questions, or to render
possible the application of the solutions obtained.

Having thus recognized, as a general principle, the close and necessary
connexion of the study of the properties of lines and surfaces with
those researches which constitute the final object of geometry, it is
evident that geometers, in the progress of their labours, must by no
means constrain themselves to keep such a connexion always in view.
Knowing, once for all, how important it is to vary as much as possible
the manner of conceiving each figure, they should pursue that study,
without considering of what immediate use such or such a special
property may be for rectifications, quadratures, and cubatures. They
would uselessly fetter their inquiries by attaching a puerile importance
to the continued establishment of that co-ordination.

This general exposition of the general object of geometry is so much the
more indispensable, since, by the very nature of the subject, this study
of the different properties of each line and of each surface necessarily
composes by far the greater part of the whole body of geometrical
researches. Indeed, the questions directly relating to rectifications,
to quadratures, and to cubatures, are evidently, by themselves, very few
in number for each figure considered. On the other hand, the study of
the properties of the same figure presents an unlimited field to the
activity of the human mind, in which it may always hope to make new
discoveries. Thus, although geometers have occupied themselves for
twenty centuries, with more or less activity undoubtedly, but without
any real interruption, in the study of the conic sections, they are far
from regarding that so simple subject as being exhausted; and it is
certain, indeed, that in continuing to devote themselves to it, they
would not fail to find still unknown properties of those different
curves. If labours of this kind have slackened considerably for a
century past, it is not because they are completed, but only, as will be
presently explained, because the philosophical revolution in geometry,
brought about by Descartes, has singularly diminished the importance of
such researches.

It results from the preceding considerations that not only is the field
of geometry necessarily infinite because of the variety of figures to
be considered, but also in virtue of the diversity of the points of view
under the same figure may be regarded. This last conception is, indeed,
that which gives the broadest and most complete idea of the whole body
of geometrical researches. We see that studies of this kind consist
essentially, for each line or for each surface, in connecting all the
geometrical phenomena which it can present, with a single fundamental
phenomenon, regarded as the primitive definition.




THE TWO GENERAL METHODS OF GEOMETRY.


Having now explained in a general and yet precise manner the final
object of geometry, and shown how the science, thus defined, comprehends
a very extensive class of researches which did not at first appear
necessarily to belong to it, there remains to be considered the _method_
to be followed for the formation of this science. This discussion is
indispensable to complete this first sketch of the philosophical
character of geometry. I shall here confine myself to indicating the
most general consideration in this matter, developing and summing up
this important fundamental idea in the following chapters.

Geometrical questions may be treated according to _two methods_ so
different, that there result from them two sorts of geometry, so to say,
the philosophical character of which does not seem to me to have yet
been properly apprehended. The expressions of _Synthetical Geometry_ and
_Analytical Geometry_, habitually employed to designate them, give a
very false idea of them. I would much prefer the purely historical
denominations of _Geometry of the Ancients_ and _Geometry of the
Moderns_, which have at least the advantage of not causing their true
character to be misunderstood. But I propose to employ henceforth the
regular expressions of _Special Geometry_ and _General Geometry_, which
seem to me suited to characterize with precision the veritable nature of
the two methods.


_Their fundamental Difference._ The fundamental difference between the
manner in which we conceive Geometry since Descartes, and the manner in
which the geometers of antiquity treated geometrical questions, is not
the use of the Calculus (or Algebra), as is commonly thought to be the
case. On the one hand, it is certain that the use of the calculus was
not entirely unknown to the ancient geometers, since they used to make
continual and very extensive applications of the theory of proportions,
which was for them, as a means of deduction, a sort of real, though very
imperfect and especially extremely limited equivalent for our present
algebra. The calculus may even be employed in a much more complete
manner than they have used it, in order to obtain certain geometrical
solutions, which will still retain all the essential character of the
ancient geometry; this occurs very frequently with respect to those
problems of geometry of two or of three dimensions, which are commonly
designated under the name of _determinate_. On the other hand, important
as is the influence of the calculus in our modern geometry, various
solutions obtained without algebra may sometimes manifest the peculiar
character which distinguishes it from the ancient geometry, although
analysis is generally indispensable. I will cite, as an example, the
method of Roberval for tangents, the nature of which is essentially
modern, and which, however, leads in certain cases to complete
solutions, without any aid from the calculus. It is not, then, the
instrument of deduction employed which is the principal distinction
between the two courses which the human mind can take in geometry.

The real fundamental difference, as yet imperfectly apprehended, seems
to me to consist in the very nature of the questions considered. In
truth, geometry, viewed as a whole, and supposed to have attained entire
perfection, must, as we have seen on the one hand, embrace all
imaginable figures, and, on the other, discover all the properties of
each figure. It admits, from this double consideration, of being treated
according to two essentially distinct plans; either, 1°, by grouping
together all the questions, however different they may be, which relate
to the same figure, and isolating those relating to different bodies,
whatever analogy there may exist between them; or, 2°, on the contrary,
by uniting under one point of view all similar inquiries, to whatever
different figures they may relate, and separating the questions relating
to the really different properties of the same body. In a word, the
whole body of geometry may be essentially arranged either with reference
to the _bodies_ studied or to the _phenomena_ to be considered. The
first plan, which is the most natural, was that of the ancients; the
second, infinitely more rational, is that of the moderns since
Descartes.


_Geometry of the Ancients._ Indeed, the principal characteristics of the
ancient geometry is that they studied, one by one, the different lines
and the different surfaces, not passing to the examination of a new
figure till they thought they had exhausted all that there was
interesting in the figures already known. In this way of proceeding,
when they undertook the study of a new curve, the whole of the labour
bestowed on the preceding ones could not offer directly any essential
assistance, otherwise than by the geometrical practice to which it had
trained the mind. Whatever might be the real similarity of the questions
proposed as to two different figures, the complete knowledge acquired
for the one could not at all dispense with taking up again the whole of
the investigation for the other. Thus the progress of the mind was never
assured; so that they could not be certain, in advance, of obtaining any
solution whatever, however analogous the proposed problem might be to
questions which had been already resolved. Thus, for example, the
determination of the tangents to the three conic sections did not
furnish any rational assistance for drawing the tangent to any other new
curve, such as the conchoid, the cissoid, &c. In a word, the geometry of
the ancients was, according to the expression proposed above,
essentially special.


_Geometry of the Moderns._ In the system of the moderns, geometry is, on
the contrary, eminently _general_, that is to say, relating to any
figures whatever. It is easy to understand, in the first place, that all
geometrical expressions of any interest may be proposed with reference
to all imaginable figures. This is seen directly in the fundamental
problems--of rectifications, quadratures, and cubatures--which
constitute, as has been shown, the final object of geometry. But this
remark is no less incontestable, even for investigations which relate to
the different _properties_ of lines and of surfaces, and of which the
most essential, such as the question of tangents or of tangent planes,
the theory of curvatures, &c., are evidently common to all figures
whatever. The very few investigations which are truly peculiar to
particular figures have only an extremely secondary importance. This
being understood, modern geometry consists essentially in abstracting,
in order to treat it by itself, in an entirely general manner, every
question relating to the same geometrical phenomenon, in whatever bodies
it may be considered. The application of the universal theories thus
constructed to the special determination of the phenomenon which is
treated of in each particular body, is now regarded as only a subaltern
labour, to be executed according to invariable rules, and the success of
which is certain in advance. This labour is, in a word, of the same
character as the numerical calculation of an analytical formula. There
can be no other merit in it than that of presenting in each case the
solution which is necessarily furnished by the general method, with all
the simplicity and elegance which the line or the surface considered can
admit of. But no real importance is attached to any thing but the
conception and the complete solution of a new question belonging to any
figure whatever. Labours of this kind are alone regarded as producing
any real advance in science. The attention of geometers, thus relieved
from the examination of the peculiarities of different figures, and
wholly directed towards general questions, has been thereby able to
elevate itself to the consideration of new geometrical conceptions,
which, applied to the curves studied by the ancients, have led to the
discovery of important properties which they had not before even
suspected. Such is geometry, since the radical revolution produced by
Descartes in the general system of the science.


_The Superiority of the modern Geometry._ The mere indication of the
fundamental character of each of the two geometries is undoubtedly
sufficient to make apparent the immense necessary superiority of modern
geometry. We may even say that, before the great conception of
Descartes, rational geometry was not truly constituted upon definitive
bases, whether in its abstract or concrete relations. In fact, as
regards science, considered speculatively, it is clear that, in
continuing indefinitely to follow the course of the ancients, as did the
moderns before Descartes, and even for a little while afterwards, by
adding some new curves to the small number of those which they had
studied, the progress thus made, however rapid it might have been, would
still be found, after a long series of ages, to be very inconsiderable
in comparison with the general system of geometry, seeing the infinite
variety of the forms which would still have remained to be studied. On
the contrary, at each question resolved according to the method of the
moderns, the number of geometrical problems to be resolved is then, once
for all, diminished by so much with respect to all possible bodies.
Another consideration is, that it resulted, from their complete want of
general methods, that the ancient geometers, in all their
investigations, were entirely abandoned to their own strength, without
ever having the certainty of obtaining, sooner or later, any solution
whatever. Though this imperfection of the science was eminently suited
to call forth all their admirable sagacity, it necessarily rendered
their progress extremely slow; we can form some idea of this by the
considerable time which they employed in the study of the conic
sections. Modern geometry, making the progress of our mind certain,
permits us, on the contrary, to make the greatest possible use of the
forces of our intelligence, which the ancients were often obliged to
waste on very unimportant questions.

A no less important difference between the two systems appears when we
come to consider geometry in the concrete point of view. Indeed, we have
already remarked that the relation of the abstract to the concrete in
geometry can be founded upon rational bases only so far as the
investigations are made to bear directly upon all imaginable figures. In
studying lines, only one by one, whatever may be the number, always
necessarily very small, of those which we shall have considered, the
application of such theories to figures really existing in nature will
never have any other than an essentially accidental character, since
there is nothing to assure us that these figures can really be brought
under the abstract types considered by geometers.

Thus, for example, there is certainly something fortuitous in the happy
relation established between the speculations of the Greek geometers
upon the conic sections and the determination of the true planetary
orbits. In continuing geometrical researches upon the same plan, there
was no good reason for hoping for similar coincidences; and it would
have been possible, in these special studies, that the researches of
geometers should have been directed to abstract figures entirely
incapable of any application, while they neglected others, susceptible
perhaps of an important and immediate application. It is clear, at
least, that nothing positively guaranteed the necessary applicability of
geometrical speculations. It is quite another thing in the modern
geometry. From the single circumstance that in it we proceed by general
questions relating to any figures whatever, we have in advance the
evident certainty that the figures really existing in the external world
could in no case escape the appropriate theory if the geometrical
phenomenon which it considers presents itself in them.

From these different considerations, we see that the ancient system of
geometry wears essentially the character of the infancy of the science,
which did not begin to become completely rational till after the
philosophical resolution produced by Descartes. But it is evident, on
the other hand, that geometry could not be at first conceived except in
this _special_ manner. _General_ geometry would not have been possible,
and its necessity could not even have been felt, if a long series of
special labours on the most simple figures had not previously furnished
bases for the conception of Descartes, and rendered apparent the
impossibility of persisting indefinitely in the primitive geometrical
philosophy.


_The Ancient the Base of the Modern._ From this last consideration we
must infer that, although the geometry which I have called _general_
must be now regarded as the only true dogmatical geometry, and that to
which we shall chiefly confine ourselves, the other having no longer
much more than an historical interest, nevertheless it is not possible
to entirely dispense with _special_ geometry in a rational exposition of
the science. We undoubtedly need not borrow directly from ancient
geometry all the results which it has furnished; but, from the very
nature of the subject, it is necessarily impossible entirely to dispense
with the ancient method, which will always serve as the preliminary
basis of the science, dogmatically as well as historically. The reason
of this is easy to understand. In fact, _general_ geometry being
essentially founded, as we shall soon establish, upon the employment of
the calculus in the transformation of geometrical into analytical
considerations, such a manner of proceeding could not take possession of
the subject immediately at its origin. We know that the application of
mathematical analysis, from its nature, can never commence any science
whatever, since evidently it cannot be employed until the science has
already been sufficiently cultivated to establish, with respect to the
phenomena considered, some _equations_ which can serve as starting
points for the analytical operations. These fundamental equations being
once discovered, analysis will enable us to deduce from them a multitude
of consequences which it would have been previously impossible even to
suspect; it will perfect the science to an immense degree, both with
respect to the generality of its conceptions and to the complete
co-ordination established between them. But mere mathematical analysis
could never be sufficient to form the bases of any natural science, not
even to demonstrate them anew when they have once been established.
Nothing can dispense with the direct study of the subject, pursued up to
the point of the discovery of precise relations.

We thus see that the geometry of the ancients will always have, by its
nature, a primary part, absolutely necessary and more or less extensive,
in the complete system of geometrical knowledge. It forms a rigorously
indispensable introduction to _general_ geometry. But it is to this that
it must be limited in a completely dogmatic exposition. I will consider,
then, directly, in the following chapter, this _special_ or
_preliminary_ geometry restricted to exactly its necessary limits, in
order to occupy myself thenceforth only with the philosophical
examination of _general_ or _definitive_ geometry, the only one which is
truly rational, and which at present essentially composes the science.




CHAPTER II.

ANCIENT OR SYNTHETIC GEOMETRY.


The geometrical method of the ancients necessarily constituting a
preliminary department in the dogmatical system of geometry, designed to
furnish _general_ geometry with indispensable foundations, it is now
proper to begin with determining wherein strictly consists this
preliminary function of _special_ geometry, thus reduced to the
narrowest possible limits.




ITS PROPER EXTENT.


_Lines; Polygons; Polyhedrons._ In considering it under this point of
view, it is easy to recognize that we might restrict it to the study of
the right line alone for what concerns the geometry of _lines_; to the
_quadrature_ of rectilinear plane areas; and, lastly, to the _cubature_
of bodies terminated by plane faces. The elementary propositions
relating to these three fundamental questions form, in fact, the
necessary starting point of all geometrical inquiries; they alone cannot
be obtained except by a direct study of the subject; while, on the
contrary, the complete theory of all other figures, even that of the
circle, and of the surfaces and volumes which are connected with it, may
at the present day be completely comprehended in the domain of _general_
or _analytical_ geometry; these primitive elements at once furnishing
_equations_ which are sufficient to allow of the application of the
calculus to geometrical questions, which would not have been possible
without this previous condition.

It results from this consideration that, in common practice, we give to
_elementary_ geometry more extent than would be rigorously necessary to
it; since, besides the right line, polygons, and polyhedrons, we also
include in it the circle and the "round" bodies; the study of which
might, however, be as purely analytical as that, for example, of the
conic sections. An unreflecting veneration for antiquity contributes to
maintain this defect in method; but the best reason which can be given
for it is the serious inconvenience for ordinary instruction which there
would be in postponing, to so distant an epoch of mathematical
education, the solution of several essential questions, which are
susceptible of a direct and continual application to a great number of
important uses. In fact, to proceed in the most rational manner, we
should employ the integral calculus in obtaining the interesting results
relating to the length or the area of the circle, or to the quadrature
of the sphere, &c., which have been determined by the ancients from
extremely simple considerations. This inconvenience would be of little
importance with regard to the persons destined to study the whole of
mathematical science, and the advantage of proceeding in a perfectly
logical order would have a much greater comparative value. But the
contrary case being the more frequent, theories so essential have
necessarily been retained in elementary geometry. Perhaps the conic
sections, the cycloid, &c., might be advantageously added in such cases.


_Not to be farther restricted._ While this preliminary portion of
geometry, which cannot be founded on the application of the calculus,
is reduced by its nature to a very limited series of fundamental
researches, relating to the right line, polygonal areas, and
polyhedrons, it is certain, on the other hand, that we cannot restrict
it any more; although, by a veritable abuse of the spirit of analysis,
it has been recently attempted to present the establishment of the
principal theorems of elementary geometry under an algebraical point of
view. Thus some have pretended to demonstrate, by simple abstract
considerations of mathematical analysis, the constant relation which
exists between the three angles of a rectilinear triangle, the
fundamental proposition of the theory of similar triangles, that of
parallelopipedons, &c.; in a word, precisely the only geometrical
propositions which cannot be obtained except by a direct study of the
subject, without the calculus being susceptible of having any part in
it. Such aberrations are the unreflecting exaggerations of that natural
and philosophical tendency which leads us to extend farther and farther
the influence of analysis in mathematical studies. In mechanics, the
pretended analytical demonstrations of the parallelogram of forces are
of similar character.

The viciousness of such a manner of proceeding follows from the
principles previously presented. We have already, in fact, recognized
that, since the calculus is not, and cannot be, any thing but a means of
deduction, it would indicate a radically false idea of it to wish to
employ it in establishing the elementary foundations of any science
whatever; for on what would the analytical reasonings in such an
operation repose? A labour of this nature, very far from really
perfecting the philosophical character of a science, would constitute a
return towards the metaphysical age, in presenting real facts as mere
logical abstractions.

When we examine in themselves these pretended analytical demonstrations
of the fundamental propositions of elementary geometry, we easily verify
their necessary want of meaning. They are all founded on a vicious
manner of conceiving the principle of _homogeneity_, the true general
idea of which was explained in the second chapter of the preceding book.
These demonstrations suppose that this principle does not allow us to
admit the coexistence in the same equation of numbers obtained by
different concrete comparisons, which is evidently false, and contrary
to the constant practice of geometers. Thus it is easy to recognize
that, by employing the law of homogeneity in this arbitrary and
illegitimate acceptation, we could succeed in "demonstrating," with
quite as much apparent rigour, propositions whose absurdity is manifest
at the first glance. In examining attentively, for example, the
procedure by the aid of which it has been attempted to prove
analytically that the sum of the three angles of any rectilinear
triangle is constantly equal to two right angles, we see that it is
founded on this preliminary principle that, if two triangles have two of
their angles respectively equal, the third angle of the one will
necessarily be equal to the third angle of the other. This first point
being granted, the proposed relation is immediately deduced from it in a
very exact and simple manner. Now the analytical consideration by which
this previous proposition has been attempted to be established, is of
such a nature that, if it could be correct, we could rigorously deduce
from it, in reproducing it conversely, this palpable absurdity, that two
sides of a triangle are sufficient, without any angle, for the entire
determination of the third side. We may make analogous remarks on all
the demonstrations of this sort, the sophisms of which will be thus
verified in a perfectly apparent manner.

The more reason that we have here to consider geometry as being at the
present day essentially analytical, the more necessary was it to guard
against this abusive exaggeration of mathematical analysis, according to
which all geometrical observation would be dispensed with, in
establishing upon pure algebraical abstractions the very foundations of
this natural science.


_Attempted Demonstrations of Axioms, &c._ Another indication that
geometers have too much overlooked the character of a natural science
which is necessarily inherent in geometry, appears from their vain
attempts, so long made, to _demonstrate_ rigorously, not by the aid of
the calculus, but by means of certain constructions, several fundamental
propositions of elementary geometry. Whatever may be effected, it will
evidently be impossible to avoid sometimes recurring to simple and
direct observation in geometry as a means of establishing various
results. While, in this science, the phenomena which are considered are,
by virtue of their extreme simplicity, much more closely connected with
one another than those relating to any other physical science, some must
still be found which cannot be deduced, and which, on the contrary,
serve as starting points. It may be admitted that the greatest logical
perfection of the science is to reduce these to the smallest number
possible, but it would be absurd to pretend to make them completely
disappear. I avow, moreover, that I find fewer real inconveniences in
extending, a little beyond what would be strictly necessary, the number
of these geometrical notions thus established by direct observation,
provided they are sufficiently simple, than in making them the subjects
of complicated and indirect demonstrations, even when these
demonstrations may be logically irreproachable.

The true dogmatic destination of the geometry of the ancients, reduced
to its least possible indispensable developments, having thus been
characterized as exactly as possible, it is proper to consider summarily
each of the principal parts of which it must be composed. I think that I
may here limit myself to considering the first and the most extensive of
these parts, that which has for its object the study of _the right
line_; the two other sections, namely, the _quadrature of polygons_ and
the _cubature of polyhedrons_, from their limited extent, not being
capable of giving rise to any philosophical consideration of any
importance, distinct from those indicated in the preceding chapter with
respect to the measure of areas and of volumes in general.




GEOMETRY OF THE RIGHT LINE.


The final question which we always have in view in the study of the
right line, properly consists in determining, by means of one another,
the different elements of any right-lined figure whatever; which enables
us always to know indirectly the length and position of a right line, in
whatever circumstances it may be placed. This fundamental problem is
susceptible of two general solutions, the nature of which is quite
distinct, the one _graphical_, the other _algebraic_. The first, though
very imperfect, is that which must be first considered, because it is
spontaneously derived from the direct study of the subject; the second,
much more perfect in the most important respects, cannot be studied till
afterwards, because it is founded upon the previous knowledge of the
other.




GRAPHICAL SOLUTIONS.


The graphical solution consists in constructing at will the proposed
figure, either with the same dimensions, or, more usually, with
dimensions changed in any ratio whatever. The first mode need merely be
mentioned as being the most simple and the one which would first occur
to the mind, for it is evidently, by its nature, almost entirely
incapable of application. The second is, on the contrary, susceptible of
being most extensively and most usefully applied. We still make an
important and continual use of it at the present day, not only to
represent with exactness the forms of bodies and their relative
positions, but even for the actual determination of geometrical
magnitudes, when we do not need great precision. The ancients, in
consequence of the imperfection of their geometrical knowledge, employed
this procedure in a much more extensive manner, since it was for a long
time the only one which they could apply, even in the most important
precise determinations. It was thus, for example, that Aristarchus of
Samos estimated the relative distance from the sun and from the moon to
the earth, by making measurements on a triangle constructed as exactly
as possible, so as to be similar to the right-angled triangle formed by
the three bodies at the instant when the moon is in quadrature, and when
an observation of the angle at the earth would consequently be
sufficient to define the triangle. Archimedes himself, although he was
the first to introduce calculated determinations into geometry, several
times employed similar means. The formation of trigonometry did not
cause this method to be entirely abandoned, although it greatly
diminished its use; the Greeks and the Arabians continued to employ it
for a great number of researches, in which we now regard the use of the
calculus as indispensable.

This exact reproduction of any figure whatever on a different scale
cannot present any great theoretical difficulty when all the parts of
the proposed figure lie in the same plane. But if we suppose, as most
frequently happens, that they are situated in different planes, we see,
then, a new order of geometrical considerations arise. The artificial
figure, which is constantly plane, not being capable, in that case, of
being a perfectly faithful image of the real figure, it is necessary
previously to fix with precision the mode of representation, which gives
rise to different systems of _Projection_.

It then remains to be determined according to what laws the geometrical
phenomena correspond in the two figures. This consideration generates a
new series of geometrical investigations, the final object of which is
properly to discover how we can replace constructions in relief by plane
constructions. The ancients had to resolve several elementary questions
of this kind for various cases in which we now employ spherical
trigonometry, principally for different problems relating to the
celestial sphere. Such was the object of their _analemmas_, and of the
other plane figures which for a long time supplied the place of the
calculus. We see by this that the ancients really knew the elements of
what we now name _Descriptive Geometry_, although they did not conceive
it in a distinct and general manner.

I think it proper briefly to indicate in this place the true
philosophical character of this "Descriptive Geometry;" although, being
essentially a science of application, it ought not to be included within
the proper domain of this work.




DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY.


All questions of geometry of three dimensions necessarily give rise,
when we consider their graphical solution, to a common difficulty which
is peculiar to them; that of substituting for the different
constructions in relief, which are necessary to resolve them directly,
and which it is almost always impossible to execute, simple equivalent
plane constructions, by means of which we finally obtain the same
results. Without this indispensable transformation, every solution of
this kind would be evidently incomplete and really inapplicable in
practice, although theoretically the constructions in space are usually
preferable as being more direct. It was in order to furnish general
means for always effecting such a transformation that _Descriptive
Geometry_ was created, and formed into a distinct and homogeneous
system, by the illustrious MONGE. He invented, in the first place, a
uniform method of representing bodies by figures traced on a single
plane, by the aid of _projections_ on two different planes, usually
perpendicular to each other, and one of which is supposed to turn about
their common intersection so as to coincide with the other produced; in
this system, or in any other equivalent to it, it is sufficient to
regard points and lines as being determined by their projections, and
surfaces by the projections of their generating lines. This being
established, Monge--analyzing with profound sagacity the various partial
labours of this kind which had before been executed by a number of
incongruous procedures, and considering also, in a general and direct
manner, in what any questions of that nature must consist--found that
they could always be reduced to a very small number of invariable
abstract problems, capable of being resolved separately, once for all,
by uniform operations, relating essentially some to the contacts and
others to the intersections of surfaces. Simple and entirely general
methods for the graphical solution of these two orders of problems
having been formed, all the geometrical questions which may arise in any
of the various arts of construction--stone-cutting, carpentry,
perspective, dialling, fortification, &c.--can henceforth be treated as
simple particular cases of a single theory, the invariable application
of which will always necessarily lead to an exact solution, which may be
facilitated in practice by profiting by the peculiar circumstances of
each case.

       *       *       *       *       *

This important creation deserves in a remarkable degree to fix the
attention of those philosophers who consider all that the human species
has yet effected as a first step, and thus far the only really complete
one, towards that general renovation of human labours, which must
imprint upon all our arts a character of precision and of rationality,
so necessary to their future progress. Such a revolution must, in fact,
inevitably commence with that class of industrial labours, which is
essentially connected with that science which is the most simple, the
most perfect, and the most ancient. It cannot fail to extend hereafter,
though with less facility, to all other practical operations. Indeed
Monge himself, who conceived the true philosophy of the arts better than
any one else, endeavoured to sketch out a corresponding system for the
mechanical arts.

Essential as the conception of descriptive geometry really is, it is
very important not to deceive ourselves with respect to its true
destination, as did those who, in the excitement of its first discovery,
saw in it a means of enlarging the general and abstract domain of
rational geometry. The result has in no way answered to these mistaken
hopes. And, indeed, is it not evident that descriptive geometry has no
special value except as a science of application, and as forming the
true special theory of the geometrical arts? Considered in its abstract
relations, it could not introduce any truly distinct order of
geometrical speculations. We must not forget that, in order that a
geometrical question should fall within the peculiar domain of
descriptive geometry, it must necessarily have been previously resolved
by speculative geometry, the solutions of which then, as we have seen,
always need to be prepared for practice in such a way as to supply the
place of constructions in relief by plane constructions; a substitution
which really constitutes the only characteristic function of descriptive
geometry.

It is proper, however, to remark here, that, with regard to intellectual
education, the study of descriptive geometry possesses an important
philosophical peculiarity, quite independent of its high industrial
utility. This is the advantage which it so pre-eminently offers--in
habituating the mind to consider very complicated geometrical
combinations in space, and to follow with precision their continual
correspondence with the figures which are actually traced--of thus
exercising to the utmost, in the most certain and precise manner, that
important faculty of the human mind which is properly called
"imagination," and which consists, in its elementary and positive
acceptation, in representing to ourselves, clearly and easily, a vast
and variable collection of ideal objects, as if they were really before
us.

Finally, to complete the indication of the general nature of descriptive
geometry by determining its logical character, we have to observe that,
while it belongs to the geometry of the ancients by the character of its
solutions, on the other hand it approaches the geometry of the moderns
by the nature of the questions which compose it. These questions are in
fact eminently remarkable for that generality which, as we saw in the
preceding chapter, constitutes the true fundamental character of modern
geometry; for the methods used are always conceived as applicable to any
figures whatever, the peculiarity of each having only a purely secondary
influence. The solutions of descriptive geometry are then graphical,
like most of those of the ancients, and at the same time general, like
those of the moderns.

       *       *       *       *       *

After this important digression, we will pursue the philosophical
examination of _special_ geometry, always considered as reduced to its
least possible development, as an indispensable introduction to
_general_ geometry. We have now sufficiently considered the _graphical_
solution of the fundamental problem relating to the right line--that
is, the determination of the different elements of any right-lined
figure by means of one another--and have now to examine in a special
manner the _algebraic_ solution.




ALGEBRAIC SOLUTIONS.


This kind of solution, the evident superiority of which need not here be
dwelt upon, belongs necessarily, by the very nature of the question, to
the system of the ancient geometry, although the logical method which is
employed causes it to be generally, but very improperly, separated from
it. We have thus an opportunity of verifying, in a very important
respect, what was established generally in the preceding chapter, that
it is not by the employment of the calculus that the modern geometry is
essentially to be distinguished from the ancient. The ancients are in
fact the true inventors of the present trigonometry, spherical as well
as rectilinear; it being only much less perfect in their hands, on
account of the extreme inferiority of their algebraical knowledge. It
is, then, really in this chapter, and not, as it might at first be
thought, in those which we shall afterwards devote to the philosophical
examination of _general_ geometry, that it is proper to consider the
character of this important preliminary theory, which is usually, though
improperly, included in what is called _analytical geometry_, but which
is really only a complement of _elementary geometry_ properly so called.

Since all right-lined figures can be decomposed into triangles, it is
evidently sufficient to know how to determine the different elements of
a triangle by means of one another, which reduces _polygonometry_ to
simple _trigonometry_.




TRIGONOMETRY.


The difficulty in resolving algebraically such a question as the above,
consists essentially in forming, between the angles and the sides of a
triangle, three distinct equations; which, when once obtained, will
evidently reduce all trigonometrical problems to mere questions of
analysis.


_How to introduce Angles._ In considering the establishment of these
equations in the most general manner, we immediately meet with a
fundamental distinction with respect to the manner of introducing the
angles into the calculation, according as they are made to enter
_directly_, by themselves or by the circular arcs which are proportional
to them; or _indirectly_, by the chords of these arcs, which are hence
called their _trigonometrical lines_. Of these two systems of
trigonometry the second was of necessity the only one originally
adopted, as being the only practicable one, since the condition of
geometry made it easy enough to find exact relations between the sides
of the triangles and the trigonometrical lines which represent the
angles, while it would have been absolutely impossible at that epoch to
establish equations between the sides and the angles themselves.


_Advantages of introducing Trigonometrical Lines._ At the present day,
since the solution can be obtained by either system indifferently, that
motive for preference no longer exists; but geometers have none the less
persisted in following from choice the system primitively admitted from
necessity; for, the same reason which enabled these trigonometrical
equations to be obtained with much more facility, must, in like manner,
as it is still more easy to conceive _à priori_, render these equations
much more simple, since they then exist only between right lines,
instead of being established between right lines and arcs of circles.
Such a consideration has so much the more importance, as the question
relates to formulas which are eminently elementary, and destined to be
continually employed in all parts of mathematical science, as well as in
all its various applications.

It may be objected, however, that when an angle is given, it is, in
reality, always given by itself, and not by its trigonometrical lines;
and that when it is unknown, it is its angular value which is properly
to be determined, and not that of any of its trigonometrical lines. It
seems, according to this, that such lines are only useless
intermediaries between the sides and the angles, which have to be
finally eliminated, and the introduction of which does not appear
capable of simplifying the proposed research. It is indeed important to
explain, with more generality and precision than is customary, the great
real utility of this manner of proceeding.


_Division of Trigonometry into two Parts._ It consists in the fact that
the introduction of these auxiliary magnitudes divides the entire
question of trigonometry into two others essentially distinct, one of
which has for its object to pass from the angles to their
trigonometrical lines, or the converse, and the other of which proposes
to determine the sides of the triangles by the trigonometrical lines of
their angles, or the converse. Now the first of these two fundamental
questions is evidently susceptible, by its nature, of being entirely
treated and reduced to numerical tables once for all, in considering all
possible angles, since it depends only upon those angles, and not at all
upon the particular triangles in which they may enter in each case;
while the solution of the second question must necessarily be renewed,
at least in its arithmetical relations, for each new triangle which it
is necessary to resolve. This is the reason why the first portion of the
complete work, which would be precisely the most laborious, is no longer
taken into the account, being always done in advance; while, if such a
decomposition had not been performed, we would evidently have found
ourselves under the obligation of recommencing the entire calculation in
each particular case. Such is the essential property of the present
trigonometrical system, which in fact would really present no actual
advantage, if it was necessary to calculate continually the
trigonometrical line of each angle to be considered, or the converse;
the intermediate agency introduced would then be more troublesome than
convenient.

In order to clearly comprehend the true nature of this conception, it
will be useful to compare it with a still more important one, designed
to produce an analogous effect either in its algebraic, or, still more,
in its arithmetical relations--the admirable theory of _logarithms_. In
examining in a philosophical manner the influence of this theory, we see
in fact that its general result is to decompose all imaginable
arithmetical operations into two distinct parts. The first and most
complicated of these is capable of being executed in advance once for
all (since it depends only upon the numbers to be considered, and not at
all upon the infinitely different combinations into which they can
enter), and consists in considering all numbers as assignable powers of
a constant number. The second part of the calculation, which must of
necessity be recommenced for each new formula which is to have its
value determined, is thenceforth reduced to executing upon these
exponents correlative operations which are infinitely more simple. I
confine myself here to merely indicating this resemblance, which any one
can carry out for himself.

We must besides observe, as a property (secondary at the present day,
but all-important at its origin) of the trigonometrical system adopted,
the very remarkable circumstance that the determination of angles by
their trigonometrical lines, or the converse, admits of an arithmetical
solution (the only one which is directly indispensable for the special
destination of trigonometry) without the previous resolution of the
corresponding algebraic question. It is doubtless to such a peculiarity
that the ancients owed the possibility of knowing trigonometry. The
investigation conceived in this way was so much the more easy, inasmuch
as tables of chords (which the ancients naturally took as the
trigonometrical lines) had been previously constructed for quite a
different object, in the course of the labours of Archimedes on the
rectification of the circle, from which resulted the actual
determination of a certain series of chords; so that when Hipparchus
subsequently invented trigonometry, he could confine himself to
completing that operation by suitable intercalations; which shows
clearly the connexion of ideas in that matter.


_The Increase of such Trigonometrical Lines._ To complete this
philosophical sketch of trigonometry, it is proper now to observe that
the extension of the same considerations which lead us to replace angles
or arcs of circles by straight lines, with the view of simplifying our
equations, must also lead us to employ concurrently several
trigonometrical lines, instead of confining ourselves to one only (as
did the ancients), so as to perfect this system by choosing that one
which will be algebraically the most convenient on each occasion. In
this point of view, it is clear that the number of these lines is in
itself no ways limited; provided that they are determined by the arc,
and that they determine it, whatever may be the law according to which
they are derived from it, they are suitable to be substituted for it in
the equations. The Arabians, and subsequently the moderns, in confining
themselves to the most simple constructions, have carried to four or
five the number of _direct_ trigonometrical lines, which might be
extended much farther.

But instead of recurring to geometrical formations, which would finally
become very complicated, we conceive with the utmost facility as many
new trigonometrical lines as the analytical transformations may require,
by means of a remarkable artifice, which is not usually apprehended in a
sufficiently general manner. It consists in not directly multiplying the
trigonometrical lines appropriate to each arc considered, but in
introducing new ones, by considering this arc as indirectly determined
by all lines relating to an arc which is a very simple function of the
first. It is thus, for example, that, in order to calculate an angle
with more facility, we will determine, instead of its sine, the sine of
its half, or of its double, &c. Such a creation of _indirect_
trigonometrical lines is evidently much more fruitful than all the
direct geometrical methods for obtaining new ones. We may accordingly
say that the number of trigonometrical lines actually employed at the
present day by geometers is in reality unlimited, since at every
instant, so to say, the transformations of analysis may lead us to
augment it by the method which I have just indicated. Special names,
however, have been given to those only of these _indirect_ lines which
refer to the complement of the primitive arc, the others not occurring
sufficiently often to render such denominations necessary; a
circumstance which has caused a common misconception of the true extent
of the system of trigonometry.


_Study of their Mutual Relations._ This multiplicity of trigonometrical
lines evidently gives rise to a third fundamental question in
trigonometry, the study of the relations which exist between these
different lines; since, without such a knowledge, we could not make use,
for our analytical necessities, of this variety of auxiliary magnitudes,
which, however, have no other destination. It is clear, besides, from
the consideration just indicated, that this essential part of
trigonometry, although simply preparatory, is, by its nature,
susceptible of an indefinite extension when we view it in its entire
generality, while the two others are circumscribed within rigorously
defined limits.

It is needless to add that these three principal parts of trigonometry
have to be studied in precisely the inverse order from that in which we
have seen them necessarily derived from the general nature of the
subject; for the third is evidently independent of the two others, and
the second, of that which was first presented--the resolution of
triangles, properly so called--which must for that reason be treated in
the last place; which rendered so much the more important the
consideration of their natural succession and logical relations to one
another.

It is useless to consider here separately _spherical trigonometry_,
which cannot give rise to any special philosophical consideration;
since, essential as it is by the importance and the multiplicity of its
uses, it can be treated at the present day only as a simple application
of rectilinear trigonometry, which furnishes directly its fundamental
equations, by substituting for the spherical triangle the corresponding
trihedral angle.

This summary exposition of the philosophy of trigonometry has been here
given in order to render apparent, by an important example, that
rigorous dependence and those successive ramifications which are
presented by what are apparently the most simple questions of elementary
geometry.

       *       *       *       *       *

Having thus examined the peculiar character of _special_ geometry
reduced to its only dogmatic destination, that of furnishing to general
geometry an indispensable preliminary basis, we have now to give all our
attention to the true science of geometry, considered as a whole, in the
most rational manner. For that purpose, it is necessary to carefully
examine the great original idea of Descartes, upon which it is entirely
founded. This will be the object of the following chapter.




CHAPTER III.

MODERN OR ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY.


_General_ (or _Analytical_) geometry being entirely founded upon the
transformation of geometrical considerations into equivalent analytical
considerations, we must begin with examining directly and in a thorough
manner the beautiful conception by which Descartes has established in a
uniform manner the constant possibility of such a co-relation. Besides
its own extreme importance as a means of highly perfecting geometrical
science, or, rather, of establishing the whole of it on rational bases,
the philosophical study of this admirable conception must have so much
the greater interest in our eyes from its characterizing with perfect
clearness the general method to be employed in organizing the relations
of the abstract to the concrete in mathematics, by the analytical
representation of natural phenomena. There is no conception, in the
whole philosophy of mathematics which better deserves to fix all our
attention.




ANALYTICAL REPRESENTATION OF FIGURES.


In order to succeed in expressing all imaginable geometrical phenomena
by simple analytical relations, we must evidently, in the first place,
establish a general method for representing analytically the subjects
themselves in which these phenomena are found, that is, the lines or the
surfaces to be considered. The _subject_ being thus habitually
considered in a purely analytical point of view, we see how it is
thenceforth possible to conceive in the same manner the various
_accidents_ of which it is susceptible.

In order to organize the representation of geometrical figures by
analytical equations, we must previously surmount a fundamental
difficulty; that of reducing the general elements of the various
conceptions of geometry to simply numerical ideas; in a word, that of
substituting in geometry pure considerations of _quantity_ for all
considerations of _quality_.


_Reduction of Figure to Position._ For this purpose let us observe, in
the first place, that all geometrical ideas relate necessarily to these
three universal categories: the _magnitude_, the _figure_, and the
_position_ of the extensions to be considered. As to the first, there is
evidently no difficulty; it enters at once into the ideas of numbers.
With relation to the second, it must be remarked that it will always
admit of being reduced to the third. For the figure of a body evidently
results from the mutual position of the different points of which it is
composed, so that the idea of position necessarily comprehends that of
figure, and every circumstance of figure can be translated by a
circumstance of position. It is in this way, in fact, that the human
mind has proceeded in order to arrive at the analytical representation
of geometrical figures, their conception relating directly only to
positions. All the elementary difficulty is then properly reduced to
that of referring ideas of situation to ideas of magnitude. Such is the
direct destination of the preliminary conception upon which Descartes
has established the general system of analytical geometry.

His philosophical labour, in this relation, has consisted simply in the
entire generalization of an elementary operation, which we may regard as
natural to the human mind, since it is performed spontaneously, so to
say, in all minds, even the most uncultivated. Thus, when we have to
indicate the situation of an object without directly pointing it out,
the method which we always adopt, and evidently the only one which can
be employed, consists in referring that object to others which are
known, by assigning the magnitude of the various geometrical elements,
by which we conceive it connected with the known objects. These elements
constitute what Descartes, and after him all geometers, have called the
_co-ordinates_ of each point considered. They are necessarily two in
number, if it is known in advance in what plane the point is situated;
and three, if it may be found indifferently in any region of space. As
many different constructions as can be imagined for determining the
position of a point, whether on a plane or in space, so many distinct
systems of co-ordinates may be conceived; they are consequently
susceptible of being multiplied to infinity. But, whatever may be the
system adopted, we shall always have reduced the ideas of situation to
simple ideas of magnitude, so that we will consider the change in the
position of a point as produced by mere numerical variations in the
values of its co-ordinates.


_Determination of the Position of a Point._ Considering at first only
the least complicated case, that of _plane geometry_, it is in this way
that we usually determine the position of a point on a plane, by its
distances from two fixed right lines considered as known, which are
called _axes_, and which are commonly supposed to be perpendicular to
each other. This system is that most frequently adopted, because of its
simplicity; but geometers employ occasionally an infinity of others.
Thus the position of a point on a plane may be determined, 1°, by its
distances from two fixed points; or, 2°, by its distance from a single
fixed point, and the direction of that distance, estimated by the
greater or less angle which it makes with a fixed right line, which
constitutes the system of what are called _polar_ co-ordinates, the most
frequently used after the system first mentioned; or, 3°, by the angles
which the right lines drawn from the variable point to two fixed points
make with the right line which joins these last; or, 4°, by the
distances from that point to a fixed right line and a fixed point, &c.
In a word, there is no geometrical figure whatever from which it is not
possible to deduce a certain system of co-ordinates more or less
susceptible of being employed.

A general observation, which it is important to make in this connexion,
is, that every system of co-ordinates is equivalent to determining a
point, in plane geometry, by the intersection of two lines, each of
which is subjected to certain fixed conditions of determination; a
single one of these conditions remaining variable, sometimes the one,
sometimes the other, according to the system considered. We could not,
indeed, conceive any other means of constructing a point than to mark it
by the meeting of two lines. Thus, in the most common system, that of
_rectilinear co-ordinates_, properly so called, the point is determined
by the intersection of two right lines, each of which remains constantly
parallel to a fixed axis, at a greater or less distance from it; in the
_polar_ system, the position of the point is marked by the meeting of a
circle, of variable radius and fixed centre, with a movable right line
compelled to turn about this centre: in other systems, the required
point might be designated by the intersection of two circles, or of any
other two lines, &c. In a word, to assign the value of one of the
co-ordinates of a point in any system whatever, is always necessarily
equivalent to determining a certain line on which that point must be
situated. The geometers of antiquity had already made this essential
remark, which served as the base of their method of geometrical _loci_,
of which they made so happy a use to direct their researches in the
resolution of _determinate_ problems, in considering separately the
influence of each of the two conditions by which was defined each point
constituting the object, direct or indirect, of the proposed question.
It was the general systematization of this method which was the
immediate motive of the labours of Descartes, which led him to create
analytical geometry.

After having clearly established this preliminary conception--by means
of which ideas of position, and thence, implicitly, all elementary
geometrical conceptions are capable of being reduced to simple numerical
considerations--it is easy to form a direct conception, in its entire
generality, of the great original idea of Descartes, relative to the
analytical representation of geometrical figures: it is this which forms
the special object of this chapter. I will continue to consider at
first, for more facility, only geometry of two dimensions, which alone
was treated by Descartes; and will afterwards examine separately, under
the same point of view, the theory of surfaces and curves of double
curvature.




PLANE CURVES.


_Expression of Lines by Equations._ In accordance with the manner of
expressing analytically the position of a point on a plane, it can be
easily established that, by whatever property any line may be defined,
that definition always admits of being replaced by a corresponding
equation between the two variable co-ordinates of the point which
describes this line; an equation which will be thenceforth the
analytical representation of the proposed line, every phenomenon of
which will be translated by a certain algebraic modification of its
equation. Thus, if we suppose that a point moves on a plane without its
course being in any manner determined, we shall evidently have to regard
its co-ordinates, to whatever system they may belong, as two variables
entirely independent of one another. But if, on the contrary, this point
is compelled to describe a certain line, we shall necessarily be
compelled to conceive that its co-ordinates, in all the positions which
it can take, retain a certain permanent and precise relation to each
other, which is consequently susceptible of being expressed by a
suitable equation; which will become the very clear and very rigorous
analytical definition of the line under consideration, since it will
express an algebraical property belonging exclusively to the
co-ordinates of all the points of this line. It is clear, indeed, that
when a point is not subjected to any condition, its situation is not
determined except in giving at once its two co-ordinates, independently
of each other; while, when the point must continue upon a defined line,
a single co-ordinate is sufficient for completely fixing its position.
The second co-ordinate is then a determinate _function_ of the first;
or, in other words, there must exist between them a certain _equation_,
of a nature corresponding to that of the line on which the point is
compelled to remain. In a word, each of the co-ordinates of a point
requiring it to be situated on a certain line, we conceive reciprocally
that the condition, on the part of a point, of having to belong to a
line defined in any manner whatever, is equivalent to assigning the
value of one of the two co-ordinates; which is found in that case to be
entirely dependent on the other. The analytical relation which expresses
this dependence may be more or less difficult to discover, but it must
evidently be always conceived to exist, even in the cases in which our
present means may be insufficient to make it known. It is by this simple
consideration that we may demonstrate, in an entirely general
manner--independently of the particular verifications on which this
fundamental conception is ordinarily established for each special
definition of a line--the necessity of the analytical representation of
lines by equations.


_Expression of Equations by Lines._ Taking up again the same reflections
in the inverse direction, we could show as easily the geometrical
necessity of the representation of every equation of two variables, in a
determinate system of co-ordinates, by a certain line; of which such a
relation would be, in the absence of any other known property, a very
characteristic definition, the scientific destination of which will be
to fix the attention directly upon the general course of the solutions
of the equation, which will thus be noted in the most striking and the
most simple manner. This picturing of equations is one of the most
important fundamental advantages of analytical geometry, which has
thereby reacted in the highest degree upon the general perfecting of
analysis itself; not only by assigning to purely abstract researches a
clearly determined object and an inexhaustible career, but, in a still
more direct relation, by furnishing a new philosophical medium for
analytical meditation which could not be replaced by any other. In fact,
the purely algebraic discussion of an equation undoubtedly makes known
its solutions in the most precise manner, but in considering them only
one by one, so that in this way no general view of them could be
obtained, except as the final result of a long and laborious series of
numerical comparisons. On the other hand, the geometrical _locus_ of the
equation, being only designed to represent distinctly and with perfect
clearness the summing up of all these comparisons, permits it to be
directly considered, without paying any attention to the details which
have furnished it. It can thereby suggest to our mind general analytical
views, which we should have arrived at with much difficulty in any other
manner, for want of a means of clearly characterizing their object. It
is evident, for example, that the simple inspection of the logarithmic
curve, or of the curve _y_ = sin. _x_, makes us perceive much more
distinctly the general manner of the variations of logarithms with
respect to their numbers, or of sines with respect to their arcs, than
could the most attentive study of a table of logarithms or of natural
sines. It is well known that this method has become entirely elementary
at the present day, and that it is employed whenever it is desired to
get a clear idea of the general character of the law which reigns in a
series of precise observations of any kind whatever.


_Any Change in the Line causes a Change in the Equation._ Returning to
the representation of lines by equations, which is our principal object,
we see that this representation is, by its nature, so faithful, that the
line could not experience any modification, however slight it might be,
without causing a corresponding change in the equation. This perfect
exactitude even gives rise oftentimes to special difficulties; for
since, in our system of analytical geometry, the mere displacements of
lines affect the equations, as well as their real variations in
magnitude or form, we should be liable to confound them with one another
in our analytical expressions, if geometers had not discovered an
ingenious method designed expressly to always distinguish them. This
method is founded on this principle, that although it is impossible to
change analytically at will the position of a line with respect to the
axes of the co-ordinates, we can change in any manner whatever the
situation of the axes themselves, which evidently amounts to the same;
then, by the aid of the very simple general formula by which this
transformation of the axes is produced, it becomes easy to discover
whether two different equations are the analytical expressions of only
the same line differently situated, or refer to truly distinct
geometrical loci; since, in the former case, one of them will pass into
the other by suitably changing the axes or the other constants of the
system of co-ordinates employed. It must, moreover, be remarked on this
subject, that general inconveniences of this nature seem to be
absolutely inevitable in analytical geometry; for, since the ideas of
position are, as we have seen, the only geometrical ideas immediately
reducible to numerical considerations, and the conceptions of figure
cannot be thus reduced, except by seeing in them relations of situation,
it is impossible for analysis to escape confounding, at first, the
phenomena of figure with simple phenomena of position, which alone are
directly expressed by the equations.


_Every Definition of a Line is an Equation._ In order to complete the
philosophical explanation of the fundamental conception which serves as
the base of analytical geometry, I think that I should here indicate a
new general consideration, which seems to me particularly well adapted
for putting in the clearest point of view this necessary representation
of lines by equations with two variables. It consists in this, that not
only, as we have shown, must every defined line necessarily give rise to
a certain equation between the two co-ordinates of any one of its
points, but, still farther, every definition of a line may be regarded
as being already of itself an equation of that line in a suitable system
of co-ordinates.

It is easy to establish this principle, first making a preliminary
logical distinction with respect to different kinds of definitions. The
rigorously indispensable condition of every definition is that of
distinguishing the object defined from all others, by assigning to it a
property which belongs to it exclusively. But this end may be generally
attained in two very different ways; either by a definition which is
simply _characteristic_, that is, indicative of a property which,
although truly exclusive, does not make known the mode of generation of
the object; or by a definition which is really _explanatory_, that is,
which characterizes the object by a property which expresses one of its
modes of generation. For example, in considering the circle as the line,
which, under the same contour, contains the greatest area, we have
evidently a definition of the first kind; while in choosing the property
of its having all its points equally distant from a fixed point, we have
a definition of the second kind. It is, besides, evident, as a general
principle, that even when any object whatever is known at first only by
a _characteristic_ definition, we ought, nevertheless, to regard it as
susceptible of _explanatory_ definitions, which the farther study of the
object would necessarily lead us to discover.

This being premised, it is clear that the general observation above
made, which represents every definition of a line as being necessarily
an equation of that line in a certain system of co-ordinates, cannot
apply to definitions which are simply _characteristic_; it is to be
understood only of definitions which are truly _explanatory_. But, in
considering only this class, the principle is easy to prove. In fact, it
is evidently impossible to define the generation of a line without
specifying a certain relation between the two simple motions of
translation or of rotation, into which the motion of the point which
describes it will be decomposed at each instant. Now if we form the most
general conception of what constitutes _a system of co-ordinates_, and
admit all possible systems, it is clear that such a relation will be
nothing else but the _equation_ of the proposed line, in a system of
co-ordinates of a nature corresponding to that of the mode of generation
considered. Thus, for example, the common definition of the _circle_ may
evidently be regarded as being immediately the _polar equation_ of this
curve, taking the centre of the circle for the pole. In the same way,
the elementary definition of the _ellipse_ or of the _hyperbola_--as
being the curve generated by a point which moves in such a manner that
the sum or the difference of its distances from two fixed points remains
constant--gives at once, for either the one or the other curve, the
equation _y_ + _x_ = _c_, taking for the system of co-ordinates that in
which the position of a point would be determined by its distances from
two fixed points, and choosing for these poles the two given foci. In
like manner, the common definition of any _cycloid_ would furnish
directly, for that curve, the equation _y_ = _mx_; adopting as the
co-ordinates of each point the arc which it marks upon a circle of
invariable radius, measuring from the point of contact of that circle
with a fixed line, and the rectilinear distance from that point of
contact to a certain origin taken on that right line. We can make
analogous and equally easy verifications with respect to the customary
definitions of spirals, of epicycloids, &c. We shall constantly find
that there exists a certain system of co-ordinates, in which we
immediately obtain a very simple equation of the proposed line, by
merely writing algebraically the condition imposed by the mode of
generation considered.

Besides its direct importance as a means of rendering perfectly apparent
the necessary representation of every line by an equation, the preceding
consideration seems to me to possess a true scientific utility, in
characterizing with precision the principal general difficulty which
occurs in the actual establishment of these equations, and in
consequently furnishing an interesting indication with respect to the
course to be pursued in inquiries of this kind, which, by their nature,
could not admit of complete and invariable rules. In fact, since any
definition whatever of a line, at least among those which indicate a
mode of generation, furnishes directly the equation of that line in a
certain system of co-ordinates, or, rather, of itself constitutes that
equation, it follows that the difficulty which we often experience in
discovering the equation of a curve, by means of certain of its
characteristic properties, a difficulty which is sometimes very great,
must proceed essentially only from the commonly imposed condition of
expressing this curve analytically by the aid of a designated system of
co-ordinates, instead of admitting indifferently all possible systems.
These different systems cannot be regarded in analytical geometry as
being all equally suitable; for various reasons, the most important of
which will be hereafter discussed, geometers think that curves should
almost always be referred, as far as is possible, to _rectilinear
co-ordinates_, properly so called. Now we see, from what precedes, that
in many cases these particular co-ordinates will not be those with
reference to which the equation of the curve will be found to be
directly established by the proposed definition. The principal
difficulty presented by the formation of the equation of a line really
consists, then, in general, in a certain transformation of co-ordinates.
It is undoubtedly true that this consideration does not subject the
establishment of these equations to a truly complete general method, the
success of which is always certain; which, from the very nature of the
subject, is evidently chimerical: but such a view may throw much useful
light upon the course which it is proper to adopt, in order to arrive at
the end proposed. Thus, after having in the first place formed the
preparatory equation, which is spontaneously derived from the definition
which we are considering, it will be necessary, in order to obtain the
equation belonging to the system of co-ordinates which must be finally
admitted, to endeavour to express in a function of these last
co-ordinates those which naturally correspond to the given mode of
generation. It is upon this last labour that it is evidently impossible
to give invariable and precise precepts. We can only say that we shall
have so many more resources in this matter as we shall know more of true
analytical geometry, that is, as we shall know the algebraical
expression of a greater number of different algebraical phenomena.




CHOICE OF CO-ORDINATES.


In order to complete the philosophical exposition of the conception
which serves as the base of analytical geometry, I have yet to notice
the considerations relating to the choice of the system of co-ordinates
which is in general the most suitable. They will give the rational
explanation of the preference unanimously accorded to the ordinary
rectilinear system; a preference which has hitherto been rather the
effect of an empirical sentiment of the superiority of this system, than
the exact result of a direct and thorough analysis.


_Two different Points of View._ In order to decide clearly between all
the different systems of co-ordinates, it is indispensable to
distinguish with care the two general points of view, the converse of
one another, which belong to analytical geometry; namely, the relation
of algebra to geometry, founded upon the representation of lines by
equations; and, reciprocally, the relation of geometry to algebra,
founded on the representation of equations by lines.

It is evident that in every investigation of general geometry these two
fundamental points of view are of necessity always found combined,
since we have always to pass alternately, and at insensible intervals,
so to say, from geometrical to analytical considerations, and from
analytical to geometrical considerations. But the necessity of here
temporarily separating them is none the less real; for the answer to the
question of method which we are examining is, in fact, as we shall see
presently, very far from being the same in both these relations, so that
without this distinction we could not form any clear idea of it.


1. _Representation of Lines by Equations._ Under _the first point of
view_--the representation of lines by equations--the only reason which
could lead us to prefer one system of co-ordinates to another would be
the greater simplicity of the equation of each line, and greater
facility in arriving at it. Now it is easy to see that there does not
exist, and could not be expected to exist, any system of co-ordinates
deserving in that respect a constant preference over all others. In
fact, we have above remarked that for each geometrical definition
proposed we can conceive a system of co-ordinates in which the equation
of the line is obtained at once, and is necessarily found to be also
very simple; and this system, moreover, inevitably varies with the
nature of the characteristic property under consideration. The
rectilinear system could not, therefore, be constantly the most
advantageous for this object, although it may often be very favourable;
there is probably no system which, in certain particular cases, should
not be preferred to it, as well as to every other.


2. _Representation of Equations by Lines._ It is by no means so,
however, under the _second point of view_. We can, indeed, easily
establish, as a general principle, that the ordinary rectilinear system
must necessarily be better adapted than any other to the representation
of equations by the corresponding geometrical _loci_; that is to say,
that this representation is constantly more simple and more faithful in
it than in any other.

Let us consider, for this object, that, since every system of
co-ordinates consists in determining a point by the intersection of two
lines, the system adapted to furnish the most suitable geometrical
_loci_ must be that in which these two lines are the simplest possible;
a consideration which confines our choice to the _rectilinear_ system.
In truth, there is evidently an infinite number of systems which deserve
that name, that is to say, which employ only right lines to determine
points, besides the ordinary system which assigns the distances from two
fixed lines as co-ordinates; such, for example, would be that in which
the co-ordinates of each point should be the two angles which the right
lines, which go from that point to two fixed points, make with the right
line, which joins these last points: so that this first consideration is
not rigorously sufficient to explain the preference unanimously given to
the common system. But in examining in a more thorough manner the nature
of every system of co-ordinates, we also perceive that each of the two
lines, whose meeting determines the point considered, must necessarily
offer at every instant, among its different conditions of determination,
a single variable condition, which gives rise to the corresponding
co-ordinate, all the rest being fixed, and constituting the _axes_ of
the system, taking this term in its most extended mathematical
acceptation. The variation is indispensable, in order that we may be
able to consider all possible positions; and the fixity is no less so,
in order that there may exist means of comparison. Thus, in all
_rectilinear_ systems, each of the two right lines will be subjected to
a fixed condition, and the ordinate will result from the variable
condition.


_Superiority of rectilinear Co-ordinates._ From these considerations it
is evident, as a general principle, that the most favourable system for
the construction of geometrical _loci_ will necessarily be that in which
the variable condition of each right line shall be the simplest
possible; the fixed condition being left free to be made complex, if
necessary to attain that object. Now, of all possible manners of
determining two movable right lines, the easiest to follow geometrically
is certainly that in which, the direction of each right line remaining
invariable, it only approaches or recedes, more or less, to or from a
constant axis. It would be, for example, evidently more difficult to
figure to one's self clearly the changes of place of a point which is
determined by the intersection of two right lines, which each turn
around a fixed point, making a greater or smaller angle with a certain
axis, as in the system of co-ordinates previously noticed. Such is the
true general explanation of the fundamental property possessed by the
common rectilinear system, of being better adapted than any other to the
geometrical representation of equations, inasmuch as it is that one in
which it is the easiest to conceive the change of place of a point
resulting from the change in the value of its co-ordinates. In order to
feel clearly all the force of this consideration, it would be sufficient
to carefully compare this system with the polar system, in which this
geometrical image, so simple and so easy to follow, of two right lines
moving parallel, each one of them, to its corresponding axis, is
replaced by the complicated picture of an infinite series of concentric
circles, cut by a right line compelled to turn about a fixed point. It
is, moreover, easy to conceive in advance what must be the extreme
importance to analytical geometry of a property so profoundly
elementary, which, for that reason, must be recurring at every instant,
and take a progressively increasing value in all labours of this kind.


_Perpendicularity of the Axes._ In pursuing farther the consideration
which demonstrates the superiority of the ordinary system of
co-ordinates over any other as to the representation of equations, we
may also take notice of the utility for this object of the common usage
of taking the two axes perpendicular to each other, whenever possible,
rather than with any other inclination. As regards the representation of
lines by equations, this secondary circumstance is no more universally
proper than we have seen the general nature of the system to be; since,
according to the particular occasion, any other inclination of the axes
may deserve our preference in that respect. But, in the inverse point of
view, it is easy to see that rectangular axes constantly permit us to
represent equations in a more simple and even more faithful manner; for,
with oblique axes, space being divided by them into regions which no
longer have a perfect identity, it follows that, if the geometrical
_locus_ of the equation extends into all these regions at once, there
will be presented, by reason merely of this inequality of the angles,
differences of figure which do not correspond to any analytical
diversity, and will necessarily alter the rigorous exactness of the
representation, by being confounded with the proper results of the
algebraic comparisons. For example, an equation like: _x^m_ + _y^m_ =
_c_, which, by its perfect symmetry, should evidently give a curve
composed of four identical quarters, will be represented, on the
contrary, if we take axes not rectangular, by a geometric _locus_, the
four parts of which will be unequal. It is plain that the only means of
avoiding all inconveniences of this kind is to suppose the angle of the
two axes to be a right angle.

The preceding discussion clearly shows that, although the ordinary
system of rectilinear co-ordinates has no constant superiority over all
others in one of the two fundamental points of view which are
continually combined in analytical geometry, yet as, on the other hand,
it is not constantly inferior, its necessary and absolute greater
aptitude for the representation of equations must cause it to generally
receive the preference; although it may evidently happen, in some
particular cases, that the necessity of simplifying equations and of
obtaining them more easily may determine geometers to adopt a less
perfect system. The rectilinear system is, therefore, the one by means
of which are ordinarily constructed the most essential theories of
general geometry, intended to express analytically the most important
geometrical phenomena. When it is thought necessary to choose some
other, the polar system is almost always the one which is fixed upon,
this system being of a nature sufficiently opposite to that of the
rectilinear system to cause the equations, which are too complicated
with respect to the latter, to become, in general, sufficiently simple
with respect to the other. Polar co-ordinates, moreover, have often the
advantage of admitting of a more direct and natural concrete
signification; as is the case in mechanics, for the geometrical
questions to which the theory of circular movement gives rise, and in
almost all the cases of celestial geometry.

       *       *       *       *       *

In order to simplify the exposition, we have thus far considered the
fundamental conception of analytical geometry only with respect to
_plane curves_, the general study of which was the only object of the
great philosophical renovation produced by Descartes. To complete this
important explanation, we have now to show summarily how this elementary
idea was extended by Clairaut, about a century afterwards, to the
general study of _surfaces_ and _curves of double curvature_. The
considerations which have been already given will permit me to limit
myself on this subject to the rapid examination of what is strictly
peculiar to this new case.




SURFACES.


_Determination of a Point in Space._ The complete analytical
determination of a point in space evidently requires the values of three
co-ordinates to be assigned; as, for example, in the system which is
generally adopted, and which corresponds to the _rectilinear_ system of
plane geometry, distances from the point to three fixed planes, usually
perpendicular to one another; which presents the point as the
intersection of three planes whose direction is invariable. We might
also employ the distances from the movable point to three fixed points,
which would determine it by the intersection of three spheres with a
common centre. In like manner, the position of a point would be defined
by giving its distance from a fixed point, and the direction of that
distance, by means of the two angles which this right line makes with
two invariable axes; this is the _polar_ system of geometry of three
dimensions; the point is then constructed by the intersection of a
sphere having a fixed centre, with two right cones with circular bases,
whose axes and common summit do not change. In a word, there is
evidently, in this case at least, the same infinite variety among the
various possible systems of co-ordinates which we have already observed
in geometry of two dimensions. In general, we have to conceive a point
as being always determined by the intersection of any three surfaces
whatever, as it was in the former case by that of two lines: each of
these three surfaces has, in like manner, all its conditions of
determination constant, excepting one, which gives rise to the
corresponding co-ordinates, whose peculiar geometrical influence is thus
to constrain the point to be situated upon that surface.

This being premised, it is clear that if the three co-ordinates of a
point are entirely independent of one another, that point can take
successively all possible positions in space. But if the point is
compelled to remain upon a certain surface defined in any manner
whatever, then two co-ordinates are evidently sufficient for determining
its situation at each instant, since the proposed surface will take the
place of the condition imposed by the third co-ordinate. We must then,
in this case, under the analytical point of view, necessarily conceive
this last co-ordinate as a determinate function of the two others, these
latter remaining perfectly independent of each other. Thus there will be
a certain equation between the three variable co-ordinates, which will
be permanent, and which will be the only one, in order to correspond to
the precise degree of indetermination in the position of the point.


_Expression of Surfaces by Equations._ This equation, more or less easy
to be discovered, but always possible, will be the analytical definition
of the proposed surface, since it must be verified for all the points of
that surface, and for them alone. If the surface undergoes any change
whatever, even a simple change of place, the equation must undergo a
more or less serious corresponding modification. In a word, all
geometrical phenomena relating to surfaces will admit of being
translated by certain equivalent analytical conditions appropriate to
equations of three variables; and in the establishment and
interpretation of this general and necessary harmony will essentially
consist the science of analytical geometry of three dimensions.


_Expression of Equations by Surfaces._ Considering next this fundamental
conception in the inverse point of view, we see in the same manner that
every equation of three variables may, in general, be represented
geometrically by a determinate surface, primitively defined by the very
characteristic property, that the co-ordinates of all its points always
retain the mutual relation enunciated in this equation. This geometrical
locus will evidently change, for the same equation, according to the
system of co-ordinates which may serve for the construction of this
representation. In adopting, for example, the rectilinear system, it is
clear that in the equation between the three variables, _x_, _y_, _z_,
every particular value attributed to _z_ will give an equation between
at _x_ and _y_, the geometrical locus of which will be a certain line
situated in a plane parallel to the plane of _x_ and _y_, and at a
distance from this last equal to the value of _z_; so that the complete
geometrical locus will present itself as composed of an infinite series
of lines superimposed in a series of parallel planes (excepting the
interruptions which may exist), and will consequently form a veritable
surface. It would be the same in considering any other system of
co-ordinates, although the geometrical construction of the equation
becomes more difficult to follow.

Such is the elementary conception, the complement of the original idea
of Descartes, on which is founded general geometry relative to surfaces.
It would be useless to take up here directly the other considerations
which have been above indicated, with respect to lines, and which any
one can easily extend to surfaces; whether to show that every definition
of a surface by any method of generation whatever is really a direct
equation of that surface in a certain system of co-ordinates, or to
determine among all the different systems of possible co-ordinates that
one which is generally the most convenient. I will only add, on this
last point, that the necessary superiority of the ordinary rectilinear
system, as to the representation of equations, is evidently still more
marked in analytical geometry of three dimensions than in that of two,
because of the incomparably greater geometrical complication which would
result from the choice of any other system. This can be verified in the
most striking manner by considering the polar system in particular,
which is the most employed after the ordinary rectilinear system, for
surfaces as well as for plane curves, and for the same reasons.

In order to complete the general exposition of the fundamental
conception relative to the analytical study of surfaces, a philosophical
examination should be made of a final improvement of the highest
importance, which Monge has introduced into the very elements of this
theory, for the classification of surfaces in natural families,
established according to the mode of generation, and expressed
algebraically by common differential equations, or by finite equations
containing arbitrary functions.




CURVES OF DOUBLE CURVATURE.


Let us now consider the last elementary point of view of analytical
geometry of three dimensions; that relating to the algebraic
representation of curves considered in space, in the most general
manner. In continuing to follow the principle which has been constantly
employed, that of the degree of indetermination of the geometrical
locus, corresponding to the degree of independence of the variables, it
is evident, as a general principle, that when a point is required to be
situated upon some certain curve, a single co-ordinate is enough for
completely determining its position, by the intersection of this curve
with the surface which results from this co-ordinate. Thus, in this
case, the two other co-ordinates of the point must be conceived as
functions necessarily determinate and distinct from the first. It
follows that every line, considered in space, is then represented
analytically, no longer by a single equation, but by the system of two
equations between the three co-ordinates of any one of its points. It is
clear, indeed, from another point of view, that since each of these
equations, considered separately, expresses a certain surface, their
combination presents the proposed line as the intersection of two
determinate surfaces. Such is the most general manner of conceiving the
algebraic representation of a line in analytical geometry of three
dimensions. This conception is commonly considered in too restricted a
manner, when we confine ourselves to considering a line as determined by
the system of its two _projections_ upon two of the co-ordinate planes;
a system characterized, analytically, by this peculiarity, that each of
the two equations of the line then contains only two of the three
co-ordinates, instead of simultaneously including the three variables.
This consideration, which consists in regarding the line as the
intersection of two cylindrical surfaces parallel to two of the three
axes of the co-ordinates, besides the inconvenience of being confined to
the ordinary rectilinear system, has the fault, if we strictly confine
ourselves to it, of introducing useless difficulties into the analytical
representation of lines, since the combination of these two cylinders
would evidently not be always the most suitable for forming the
equations of a line. Thus, considering this fundamental notion in its
entire generality, it will be necessary in each case to choose, from
among the infinite number of couples of surfaces, the intersection of
which might produce the proposed curve, that one which will lend itself
the best to the establishment of equations, as being composed of the
best known surfaces. Thus, if the problem is to express analytically a
circle in space, it will evidently be preferable to consider it as the
intersection of a sphere and a plane, rather than as proceeding from any
other combination of surfaces which could equally produce it.

In truth, this manner of conceiving the representation of lines by
equations, in analytical geometry of three dimensions, produces, by its
nature, a necessary inconvenience, that of a certain analytical
confusion, consisting in this: that the same line may thus be expressed,
with the same system of co-ordinates, by an infinite number of different
couples of equations, on account of the infinite number of couples of
surfaces which can form it; a circumstance which may cause some
difficulties in recognizing this line under all the algebraical
disguises of which it admits. But there exists a very simple method for
causing this inconvenience to disappear; it consists in giving up the
facilities which result from this variety of geometrical constructions.
It suffices, in fact, whatever may be the analytical system primitively
established for a certain line, to be able to deduce from it the system
corresponding to a single couple of surfaces uniformly generated; as,
for example, to that of the two cylindrical surfaces which _project_ the
proposed line upon two of the co-ordinate planes; surfaces which will
evidently be always identical, in whatever manner the line may have been
obtained, and which will not vary except when that line itself shall
change. Now, in choosing this fixed system, which is actually the most
simple, we shall generally be able to deduce from the primitive
equations those which correspond to them in this special construction,
by transforming them, by two successive eliminations, into two
equations, each containing only two of the variable co-ordinates, and
thereby corresponding to the two surfaces of projection. Such is really
the principal destination of this sort of geometrical combination, which
thus offers to us an invariable and certain means of recognizing the
identity of lines in spite of the diversity of their equations, which is
sometimes very great.




IMPERFECTIONS OF ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY.


Having now considered the fundamental conception of analytical geometry
under its principal elementary aspects, it is proper, in order to make
the sketch complete, to notice here the general imperfections yet
presented by this conception with respect to both geometry and to
analysis.

_Relatively to geometry_, we must remark that the equations are as yet
adapted to represent only entire geometrical loci, and not at all
determinate portions of those loci. It would, however, be necessary, in
some circumstances, to be able to express analytically a part of a line
or of a surface, or even a _discontinuous_ line or surface, composed of
a series of sections belonging to distinct geometrical figures, such as
the contour of a polygon, or the surface of a polyhedron. Thermology,
especially, often gives rise to such considerations, to which our
present analytical geometry is necessarily inapplicable. The labours of
M. Fourier on discontinuous functions have, however, begun to fill up
this great gap, and have thereby introduced a new and essential
improvement into the fundamental conception of Descartes. But this
manner of representing heterogeneous or partial figures, being founded
on the employment of trigonometrical series proceeding according to the
sines of an infinite series of multiple arcs, or on the use of certain
definite integrals equivalent to those series, and the general integral
of which is unknown, presents as yet too much complication to admit of
being immediately introduced into the system of analytical geometry.

_Relatively to analysis_, we must begin by observing that our inability
to conceive a geometrical representation of equations containing four,
five, or more variables, analogous to those representations which all
equations of two or of three variables admit, must not be viewed as an
imperfection of our system of analytical geometry, for it evidently
belongs to the very nature of the subject. Analysis being necessarily
more general than geometry, since it relates to all possible phenomena,
it would be very unphilosophical to desire always to find among
geometrical phenomena alone a concrete representation of all the laws
which analysis can express.

There exists, however, another imperfection of less importance, which
must really be viewed as proceeding from the manner in which we conceive
analytical geometry. It consists in the evident incompleteness of our
present representation of equations of two or of three variables by
lines or surfaces, inasmuch as in the construction of the geometric
locus we pay regard only to the _real_ solutions of equations, without
at all noticing any _imaginary_ solutions. The general course of these
last should, however, by its nature, be quite as susceptible as that of
the others of a geometrical representation. It follows from this
omission that the graphic picture of the equation is constantly
imperfect, and sometimes even so much so that there is no geometric
representation at all when the equation admits of only imaginary
solutions. But, even in this last case, we evidently ought to be able to
distinguish between equations as different in themselves as these, for
example,

  _x²_ + _y²_ + 1 = 0, _x⁶_ + _y⁴_ + 1 = 0, _y²_ + _e^x_ = 0.

We know, moreover, that this principal imperfection often brings with
it, in analytical geometry of two or of three dimensions, a number of
secondary inconveniences, arising from several analytical modifications
not corresponding to any geometrical phenomena.

       *       *       *       *       *

Our philosophical exposition of the fundamental conception of analytical
geometry shows us clearly that this science consists essentially in
determining what is the general analytical expression of such or such a
geometrical phenomenon belonging to lines or to surfaces; and,
reciprocally, in discovering the geometrical interpretation of such or
such an analytical consideration. A detailed examination of the most
important general questions would show us how geometers have succeeded
in actually establishing this beautiful harmony, and in thus imprinting
on geometrical science, regarded as a whole, its present eminently
perfect character of rationality and of simplicity.

     _Note._--The author devotes the two following chapters of his
     course to the more detailed examination of Analytical Geometry of
     two and of three dimensions; but his subsequent publication of a
     separate work upon this branch of mathematics has been thought to
     render unnecessary the reproduction of these two chapters in the
     present volume.


THE END.1. ACCURATE MEASUREMENT.--Accurate measurement is the foundation of
exact science, and at the very beginning of his study in astronomy the
student should learn something of the astronomer's kind of measurement.
He should practice measuring the stars with all possible care, and
should seek to attain the most accurate results of which his instruments
and apparatus are capable. The ordinary affairs of life furnish abundant
illustration of some of these measurements, such as finding the length
of a board in inches or the weight of a load of coal in pounds and
measurements of both length and weight are of importance in astronomy,
but of far greater astronomical importance than these are the
measurement of angles and the measurement of time. A kitchen clock or a
cheap watch is usually thought of as a machine to tell the "time of
day," but it may be used to time a horse or a bicycler upon a race
course, and then it becomes an instrument to measure the amount of time
required for covering the length of the course. Astronomers use a clock
in both of these ways--to tell the time at which something happens or is
done, and to measure the amount of time required for something; and in
using a clock for either purpose the student should learn to take the
time from it to the nearest second or better, if it has a seconds hand,
or to a small fraction of a minute, by estimating the position of the
minute hand between the minute marks on the dial. Estimate the fraction
in tenths of a minute, not in halves or quarters.

EXERCISE 1.--If several watches are available, let one person tap
sharply upon a desk with a pencil and let each of the others note the
time by the minute hand to the nearest tenth of a minute and record the
observations as follows:

    2h. 44.5m.  First tap.   2h. 46.4m.  1.9m.
    2h. 44.9m.  Second tap.  2h. 46.7m.  1.8m.
    2h. 46.6m.  Third tap.   2h. 48.6m.  2.0m.

The letters h and m are used as abbreviations for hour and minute. The
first and second columns of the table are the record made by one
student, and second and third the record made by another. After all the
observations have been made and recorded they should be brought together
and compared by taking the differences between the times recorded for
each tap, as is shown in the last column. This difference shows how much
faster one watch is than the other, and the agreement or disagreement of
these differences shows the degree of accuracy of the observations. Keep
up this practice until tenths of a minute can be estimated with fair
precision.

2. ANGLES AND THEIR USE.--An angle is the amount of opening or
difference of direction between two lines that cross each other. At
twelve o'clock the hour and minute hand of a watch point in the same
direction and the angle between them is zero. At one o'clock the minute
hand is again at XII, but the hour hand has moved to I, one twelfth part
of the circumference of the dial, and the angle between the hands is one
twelfth of a circumference. It is customary to imagine the circumference
of a dial to be cut up into 360 equal parts--i. e., each minute space of
an ordinary dial to be subdivided into six equal parts, each of which
is called a degree, and the measurement of an angle consists in finding
how many of these degrees are included in the opening between its sides.
At one o'clock the angle between the hands of a watch is thirty degrees,
which is usually written 30°, at three o'clock it is 90°, at six o'clock
180°, etc.

A watch may be used to measure angles. How? But a more convenient
instrument is the protractor, which is shown in Fig. 1, applied to the
angle _A B C_ and showing that _A B C_ = 85° as nearly as the protractor
scale can be read.

The student should have and use a protractor, such as is furnished with
this book, for the numerous exercises which are to follow.

[Illustration: FIG. 1.--A protractor.]

EXERCISE 2.--Draw neatly a triangle with sides about 100 millimeters
long, measure each of its angles and take their sum. No matter what may
be the shape of the triangle, this sum should be very nearly
180°--exactly 180° if the work were perfect--but perfection can seldom
be attained and one of the first lessons to be learned in any science
which deals with measurement is, that however careful we may be in our
work some minute error will cling to it and our results can be only
approximately correct. This, however, should not be taken as an excuse
for careless work, but rather as a stimulus to extra effort in order
that the unavoidable errors may be made as small as possible. In the
present case the measured angles may be improved a little by adding
(algebraically) to each of them one third of the amount by which their
sum falls short of 180°, as in the following example:

            Measured angles.    Correction.  Corrected angles.
                 °                   °              °
  A            73.4               + 0.1           73.5
  B            49.3               + 0.1           49.4
  C            57.0               + 0.1           57.1
              -----                              -----
  Sum         179.7                              180.0
  Defect      + 0.3

This process is in very common use among astronomers, and is called
"adjusting" the observations.

[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Triangulation.]

3. TRIANGLES.--The instruments used by astronomers for the measurement
of angles are usually provided with a telescope, which may be pointed at
different objects, and with a scale, like that of the protractor, to
measure the angle through which the telescope is turned in passing from
one object to another. In this way it is possible to measure the angle
between lines drawn from the instrument to two distant objects, such as
two church steeples or the sun and moon, and this is usually called the
angle between the objects. By measuring angles in this way it is
possible to determine the distance to an inaccessible point, as shown in
Fig. 2. A surveyor at _A_ desires to know the distance to _C_, on the
opposite side of a river which he can not cross. He measures with a tape
line along his own side of the stream the distance _A B_ = 100 yards and
then, with a suitable instrument, measures the angle at _A_ between the
points _C_ and _B_, and the angle at _B_ between _C_ and _A_, finding _B
A C_ = 73.4°, _A B C_ = 49.3°. To determine the distance _A C_ he draws
upon paper a line 100 millimeters long, and marks the ends _a_ and _b_;
with a protractor he constructs at _a_ the angle _b a c_ = 73.4°, and at
_b_ the angle _a b c_ = 49.3°, and marks by _c_ the point where the two
lines thus drawn meet. With the millimeter scale he now measures the
distance _a c_ = 90.2 millimeters, which determines the distance _A C_
across the river to be 90.2 yards, since the triangle on paper has been
made similar to the one across the river, and millimeters on the one
correspond to yards on the other. What is the proposition of geometry
upon which this depends? The measured distance _A B_ in the surveyor's
problem is called a base line.

EXERCISE 3.--With a foot rule and a protractor measure a base line and
the angles necessary to determine the length of the schoolroom. After
the length has been thus found, measure it directly with the foot rule
and compare the measured length with the one found from the angles. If
any part of the work has been carelessly done, the student need not
expect the results to agree.

[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Finding the moon's distance from the earth.]

In the same manner, by sighting at the moon from widely different parts
of the earth, as in Fig. 3, the moon's distance from us is found to be
about a quarter of a million miles. What is the base line in this case?

4. THE HORIZON--ALTITUDES.--In their observations astronomers and
sailors make much use of the _plane of the horizon_, and practically any
flat and level surface, such as that of a smooth pond, may be regarded
as a part of this plane and used as such. A very common observation
relating to the plane of the horizon is called "taking the sun's
altitude," and consists in measuring the angle between the sun's rays
and the plane of the horizon upon which they fall. This angle between a
line and a plane appears slightly different from the angle between two
lines, but is really the same thing, since it means the angle between
the sun's rays and a line drawn in the plane of the horizon toward the
point directly under the sun. Compare this with the definition given in
the geographies, "The latitude of a point on the earth's surface is its
angular distance north or south of the equator," and note that the
latitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line drawn
from the earth's center to the given point on its surface.

A convenient method of obtaining a part of the plane of the horizon for
use in observation is as follows: Place a slate or a pane of glass upon
a table in the sunshine. Slightly moisten its whole surface and then
pour a little more water upon it near the center. If the water runs
toward one side, thrust the edge of a thin wooden wedge under this side
and block it up until the water shows no tendency to run one way rather
than another; it is then level and a part of the plane of the horizon.
Get several wedges ready before commencing the experiment. After they
have been properly placed, drive a pin or tack behind each one so that
it may not slip.

5. TAKING THE SUN'S ALTITUDE. EXERCISE 4.--Prepare a piece of board 20
centimeters, or more, square, planed smooth on one face and one edge.
Drive a pin perpendicularly into the face of the board, near the middle
of the planed edge. Set the board on edge on the horizon plane and turn
it edgewise toward the sun so that a shadow of the pin is cast on the
plane. Stick another pin into the board, near its upper edge, so that
its shadow shall fall exactly upon the shadow of the first pin, and with
a watch or clock observe the time at which the two shadows coincide.
Without lifting the board from the plane, turn it around so that the
opposite edge is directed toward the sun and set a third pin just as the
second one was placed, and again take the time. Remove the pins and draw
fine pencil lines, connecting the holes, as shown in Fig. 4, and with
the protractor measure the angle thus marked. The student who has
studied elementary geometry should be able to demonstrate that at the
mean of the two recorded times the sun's altitude was equal to one half
of the angle measured in the figure.

[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Taking the sun's altitude.]

When the board is turned edgewise toward the sun so that its shadow is
as thin as possible, rule a pencil line alongside it on the horizon
plane. The angle which this line makes with a line pointing due south is
called the sun's _azimuth_. When the sun is south, its azimuth is zero;
when west, it is 90°; when east, 270°, etc.

EXERCISE 5.--Let a number of different students take the sun's altitude
during both the morning and afternoon session and note the time of each
observation, to the nearest minute. Verify the setting of the plane of
the horizon from time to time, to make sure that no change has occurred
in it.

6. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS.--Make a graph (drawing) of all the
observations, similar to Fig. 5, and find by bisecting a set of chords
_g_ to _g_, _e_ to _e_, _d_ to _d_, drawn parallel to _B B_, the time at
which the sun's altitude was greatest. In Fig. 5 we see from the
intersection of _M M_ with _B B_ that this time was 11h. 50m.

The method of graphs which is here introduced is of great importance in
physical science, and the student should carefully observe in Fig. 5
that the line _B B_ is a scale of times, which may be made long or
short, provided only the intervals between consecutive hours 9 to 10, 10
to 11, 11 to 12, etc., are equal. The distance of each little circle
from _B B_ is taken proportional to the sun's altitude, and may be upon
any desired scale--e. g., a millimeter to a degree--provided the same
scale is used for all observations. Each circle is placed accurately
over that part of the base line which corresponds to the time at which
the altitude was taken. Square ruled paper is very convenient, although
not necessary, for such diagrams. It is especially to be noted that from
the few observations which are represented in the figure a smooth curve
has been drawn through the circles which represent the sun's altitude,
and this curve shows the altitude of the sun at every moment between 9
A. M. and 3 P. M. In Fig. 5 the sun's altitude at noon was 57°. What was
it at half past two?

[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A graph of the sun's altitude.]

7. DIAMETER OF A DISTANT OBJECT.--By sighting over a protractor, measure
the angle between imaginary lines drawn from it to the opposite sides of
a window. Carry the protractor farther away from the window and repeat
the experiment, to see how much the angle changes. The angle thus
measured is called "the angle subtended" by the window at the place
where the measurement was made. If this place was squarely in front of
the window we may draw upon paper an angle equal to the measured one and
lay off from the vertex along its sides a distance proportional to the
distance of the window--e. g., a millimeter for each centimeter of real
distance. If a cross line be now drawn connecting the points thus found,
its length will be proportional to the width of the window, and the
width may be read off to scale, a centimeter for every millimeter in the
length of the cross line.

The astronomer who measures with an appropriate instrument the angle
subtended by the moon may in an entirely similar manner find the moon's
diameter and has, in fact, found it to be 2,163 miles. Can the same
method be used to find the diameter of the sun? A planet? The earth?




CHAPTER II

THE STARS AND THEIR DIURNAL MOTION


8. THE STARS.--From the very beginning of his study in astronomy, and as
frequently as possible, the student should practice watching the stars
by night, to become acquainted with the constellations and their
movements. As an introduction to this study he may face toward the
north, and compare the stars which he sees in that part of the sky with
the map of the northern heavens, given on Plate I, opposite page 124.
Turn the map around, upside down if necessary, until the stars upon it
match the brighter ones in the sky. Note how the stars are grouped in
such conspicuous constellations as the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the
Little Dipper (Ursa Minor), and Cassiopeia. These three constellations
should be learned so that they can be recognized at any time.

_The names of the stars._--Facing the star map is a key which contains
the names of the more important constellations and the names of the
brighter stars in their constellations. These names are for the most
part a Greek letter prefixed to the genitive case of the Latin name of
the constellation. (See the Greek alphabet printed at the end of the
book.)

9. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS.--Nearly nineteen centuries ago St. Paul
noted that "one star differeth from another star in glory," and no more
apt words can be found to mark the difference of brightness which the
stars present. Even prior to St. Paul's day the ancient Greek
astronomers had divided the stars in respect of brightness into six
groups, which the modern astronomers still use, calling each group a
_magnitude_. Thus a few of the brightest stars are said to be of the
first magnitude, the great mass of faint ones which are just visible to
the unaided eye are said to be of the sixth magnitude, and intermediate
degrees of brilliancy are represented by the intermediate magnitudes,
second, third, fourth, and fifth. The student must not be misled by the
word magnitude. It has no reference to the size of the stars, but only
to their brightness, and on the star maps of this book the larger and
smaller circles by which the stars are represented indicate only the
brightness of the stars according to the system of magnitudes. Following
the indications of these maps, the student should, in learning the
principal stars and constellations, learn also to recognize how bright
is a star of the second, fourth, or other magnitude.

10. OBSERVING THE STARS.--Find on the map and in the sky the stars
α Ursæ Minoris, α Ursæ Majoris, β Ursæ Majoris. What geometrical
figure will fit on to these stars? In addition to its regular name,
α Ursæ Minoris is frequently called by the special name Polaris, or
the pole star. Why are the other two stars called "the Pointers"? What
letter of the alphabet do the five bright stars in Cassiopeia suggest?

EXERCISE 6.--Stand in such a position that Polaris is just hidden behind
the corner of a building or some other vertical line, and mark upon the
key map as accurately as possible the position of this line with respect
to the other stars, showing which stars are to the right and which are
to the left of it. Record the time (date, hour, and minute) at which
this observation was made. An hour or two later repeat the observation
at the same place, draw the line and note the time, and you will find
that the line last drawn upon the map does not agree with the first one.
The stars have changed their positions, and with respect to the vertical
line the Pointers are now in a different direction from Polaris.
Measure with a protractor the angle between the two lines drawn in the
map, and use this angle and the recorded times of the observation to
find how many degrees per hour this direction is changing. It should be
about 15° per hour. If the observation were repeated 12 hours after the
first recorded time, what would be the position of the vertical line
among the stars? What would it be 24 hours later? A week later? Repeat
the observation on the next clear night, and allowing for the number of
whole revolutions made by the stars between the two dates, again
determine from the time interval a more accurate value of the rate at
which the stars move.

The motion of the stars which the student has here detected is called
their "diurnal" motion. What is the significance of the word diurnal?

In the preceding paragraph there is introduced a method of great
importance in astronomical practice--i. e., determining something--in
this case the rate per hour, from observations separated by a long
interval of time, in order to get a more accurate value than could be
found from a short interval. Why is it more accurate? To determine the
rate at which the planet Mars rotates about its axis, astronomers use
observations separated by an interval of more than 200 years, during
which the planet made more than 75,000 revolutions upon its axis. If we
were to write out in algebraic form an equation for determining the
length of one revolution of Mars about its axis, the large number,
75,000, would appear in the equation as a divisor, and in the final
result would greatly reduce whatever errors existed in the observations
employed.

Repeat Exercise 6 night after night, and note whether the stars come
back to the same position at the same hour and minute every night.

[Illustration: FIG. 6. The plumb-line apparatus.]

[Illustration: FIG. 7. The plumb-line apparatus.]

11. THE PLUMB-LINE APPARATUS.--This experiment, and many others, may be
conveniently and accurately made with no other apparatus than a plumb
line, and a device for sighting past it. In Figs. 6 and 7 there is
shown a simple form of such apparatus, consisting essentially of a board
which rests in a horizontal position upon the points of three screws
that pass through it. This board carries a small box, to one side of
which is nailed in vertical position another board 5 or 6 feet long to
carry the plumb line. This consists of a wire or fish line with any
heavy weight--e. g., a brick or flatiron--tied to its lower end and
immersed in a vessel of water placed inside the box, so as to check any
swinging motion of the weight. In the cover of the box is a small hole
through which the wire passes, and by turning the screws in the
baseboard the apparatus may be readily leveled, so that the wire shall
swing freely in the center of the hole without touching the cover of the
box. Guy wires, shown in the figure, are applied so as to stiffen the
whole apparatus. A board with a screw eye at each end may be pivoted to
the upright, as in Fig. 6, for measuring altitudes; or to the box, as in
Fig. 7, for observing the time at which a star in its diurnal motion
passes through the plane determined by the plumb line and the center of
the screw eye through which the observer looks.

The whole apparatus may be constructed by any person of ordinary
mechanical skill at a very small cost, and it or something equivalent
should be provided for every class beginning observational astronomy. To
use the apparatus for the experiment of § 10, it should be leveled, and
the board with the screw eyes, attached as in Fig. 7, should be turned
until the observer, looking through the screw eye, sees Polaris exactly
behind the wire. Use a bicycle lamp to illumine the wire by night. The
apparatus is now adjusted, and the observer has only to wait for the
stars which he desires to observe, and to note by his watch the time at
which they pass behind the wire. It will be seen that the wire takes the
place of the vertical edge of the building, and that the board with the
screw eyes is introduced solely to keep the observer in the right place
relative to the wire.

12. A SIDEREAL CLOCK.--Clocks are sometimes so made and regulated that
they show always the same hour and minute when the stars come back to
the same place, and such a timepiece is called a sidereal clock--i. e.,
a star-time clock. Would such a clock gain or lose in comparison with an
ordinary watch? Could an ordinary watch be turned into a sidereal watch
by moving the regulator?

[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photographing the circumpolar stars.--BARNARD.]

13. PHOTOGRAPHING THE STARS.--EXERCISE 7.--For any student who uses a
camera. Upon some clear and moonless night point the camera, properly
focused, at Polaris, and expose a plate for three or four hours. Upon
developing the plate you should find a series of circular trails such as
are shown in Fig. 8, only longer. Each one of these is produced by a
star moving slowly over the plate, in consequence of its changing
position in the sky. The center indicated by these curved trails is
called the pole of the heavens. It is that part of the sky toward which
is pointed the axis about which the earth rotates, and the motion of the
stars around the center is only an apparent motion due to the rotation
of the earth which daily carries the observer and his camera around this
axis while the stars stand still, just as trees and fences and telegraph
poles stand still, although to the passenger upon a railway train they
appear to be in rapid motion. So far as simple observations are
concerned, there is no method by which the pupil can tell for himself
that the motion of the stars is an apparent rather than a real one, and,
following the custom of astronomers, we shall habitually speak as if it
were a real movement of the stars. How long was the plate exposed in
photographing Fig. 8?

14. FINDING THE STARS.--On Plate I, opposite page 124, the pole of the
heavens is at the center of the map, near Polaris, and the heavy trail
near the center of Fig. 8 is made by Polaris. See if you can identify
from the map any of the stars whose trails show in the photograph. The
brighter the star the bolder and heavier its trail.

Find from the map and locate in the sky the two bright stars Capella and
Vega, which are on opposite sides of Polaris and nearly equidistant from
it. Do these stars share in the motion around the pole? Are they visible
on every clear night, and all night?

Observe other bright stars farther from Polaris than are Vega and
Capella and note their movement. Do they move like the sun and moon? Do
they rise and set?

In what part of the sky do the stars move most rapidly, near the pole or
far from it?

How long does it take the fastest moving stars to make the circuit of
the sky and come back to the same place? How long does it take the slow
stars?

15. RISING AND SETTING OF THE STARS.--A study of the sky along the lines
indicated in these questions will show that there is a considerable part
of it surrounding the pole whose stars are visible on every clear night.
The same star is sometimes high in the sky, sometimes low, sometimes to
the east of the pole and at other times west of it, but is always above
the horizon. Such stars are said to be circumpolar. A little farther
from the pole each star, when at the lowest point of its circular path,
dips for a time below the horizon and is lost to view, and the farther
it is away from the pole the longer does it remain invisible, until, in
the case of stars 90° away from the pole, we find them hidden below the
horizon for twelve hours out of every twenty-four (see Fig. 9). The sun
is such a star, and in its rising and setting acts precisely as does
every other star at a similar distance from the pole--only, as we shall
find later, each star keeps always at (nearly) the same distance from
the pole, while the sun in the course of a year changes its distance
from the pole very greatly, and thus changes the amount of time it
spends above and below the horizon, producing in this way the long days
of summer and the short ones of winter.

[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Diurnal motion of the northern constellations.]

How much time do stars which are more than 90° from the pole spend above
the horizon?

We say in common speech that the sun rises in the east, but this is
strictly true only at the time when it is 90° distant from the
pole--i. e., in March and September. At other seasons it rises north or
south of east according as its distance from the pole is less or greater
than 90°, and the same is true for the stars.

16. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SKY.--Find from a map the latitude and
longitude of your schoolhouse. Find on the map the place whose latitude
is 39° and longitude 77° west of the meridian of Greenwich. Is there any
other place in the world which has the same latitude and longitude as
your schoolhouse?

The places of the stars in the sky are located in exactly the manner
which is illustrated by these geographical questions, only different
names are used. Instead of latitude the astronomer says _declination_,
in place of longitude he says _right ascension_, in place of meridian he
says _hour circle_, but he means by these new names the same ideas that
the geographer expresses by the old ones.

Imagine the earth swollen up until it fills the whole sky; the earth's
equator would meet the sky along a line (a great circle) everywhere 90°
distant from the pole, and this line is called the _celestial equator_.
Trace its position along the middle of the map opposite page 190 and
notice near what stars it runs. Every meridian of the swollen earth
would touch the sky along an hour circle--i. e., a great circle passing
through the pole and therefore perpendicular to the equator. Note that
in the map one of these hour circles is marked 0. It plays the same part
in measuring right ascensions as does the meridian of Greenwich in
measuring longitudes; it is the beginning, from which they are reckoned.
Note also, at the extreme left end of the map, the four bright stars in
the form of a square, one side of which is parallel and close to the
hour circle, which is marked 0. This is familiarly called the Great
Square in Pegasus, and may be found high up in the southern sky whenever
the Big Dipper lies below the pole. Why can it not be seen when Ursa
Major is above the pole?

Astronomers use the right ascensions of the stars not only to tell in
what part of the sky the star is placed, but also in time reckonings, to
regulate their sidereal clocks, and with regard to this use they find
it convenient to express right ascension not in degrees but in hours,
24 of which fill up the circuit of the sky and each of which is equal
to 15° of arc, 24 × 15 = 360. The right ascension of Capella is
5h. 9m. = 77.2°, but the student should accustom himself to using it
in hours and minutes as given and not to change it into degrees. He
should also note that some stars lie on the side of the celestial
equator toward Polaris, and others are on the opposite side, so that the
astronomer has to distinguish between north declinations and south
declinations, just as the geographer distinguishes between north
latitudes and south latitudes. This is done by the use of the + and -
signs, a + denoting that the star lies north of the celestial equator,
i. e., toward Polaris.

[Illustration: FIG. 10.--From a photograph of the Pleiades.]

Find on Plate II, opposite page 190, the Pleiades (Plēadēs),
R. A. = 3h. 42m., Dec. = +23.8°. Why do they not show on Plate I,
opposite page 124? In what direction are they from Polaris? This is one
of the finest star clusters in the sky, but it needs a telescope to
bring out its richness. See how many stars you can count in it with the
naked eye, and afterward examine it with an opera glass. Compare what
you see with Fig. 10. Find Antares, R. A. = 16h. 23m. Dec. = -26.2°. How
far is it, in degrees, from the pole? Is it visible in your sky? If so,
what is its color?

Find the R. A. and Dec. of α Ursæ Majoris; of β Ursæ Majoris; of
Polaris. Find the Northern Crown, _Corona Borealis_, R. A. = 15h. 30m.,
Dec. = +27.0°; the Beehive, _Præsepe_, R. A. = 8h. 33m., Dec. = +20.4°.

These should be looked up, not only on the map, but also in the sky.

17. REFERENCE LINES AND CIRCLES.--As the stars move across the sky in
their diurnal motion, they carry the framework of hour circles and
equator with them, so that the right ascension and declination of each
star remain unchanged by this motion, just as longitudes and latitudes
remain unchanged by the earth's rotation. They are the same when a star
is rising and when it is setting; when it is above the pole and when it
is below it. During each day the hour circle of every star in the
heavens passes overhead, and at the moment when any particular hour
circle is exactly overhead all the stars which lie upon it are said to
be "on the meridian"--i. e., at that particular moment they stand
directly over the observer's geographical meridian and upon the
corresponding celestial meridian.

An eye placed at the center of the earth and capable of looking through
its solid substance would see your geographical meridian against the
background of the sky exactly covering your celestial meridian and
passing from one pole through your zenith to the other pole. In Fig. 11
the inner circle represents the terrestrial meridian of a certain
place, _O_, as seen from the center of the earth, _C_, and the outer
circle represents the celestial meridian of _O_ as seen from _C_, only
we must imagine, what can not be shown on the figure, that the outer
circle is so large that the inner one shrinks to a mere point in
comparison with it. If _C P_ represents the direction in which the
earth's axis passes through the center, then _C E_ at right angles to it
must be the direction of the equator which we suppose to be turned
edgewise toward us; and if _C O_ is the direction of some particular
point on the earth's surface, then _Z_ directly overhead is called the
_zenith_ of that point, upon the celestial sphere. The line _C H_
represents a direction parallel to the horizon plane at _O_, and _H C P_
is the angle which the axis of the earth makes with this horizon plane.
The arc _O E_ measures the latitude of _O_, and the arc _Z E_ measures
the declination of _Z_, and since by elementary geometry each of these
arcs contains the same number of degrees as the angle _E C Z_, we have
the

_Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the declination of its
zenith.

_Corollary._--Any star whose declination is equal to your latitude will
once in each day pass through your zenith.

[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Reference lines and circles.]

18. LATITUDE.--From the construction of the figure

    ∠ _E C Z_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°
    ∠ _H C P_ + ∠ _Z C P_ = 90°

from which we find by subtraction and transposition

    ∠ _E C Z_ = ∠ _H C P_

and this gives the further

_Theorem._--The latitude of any place is equal to the elevation of the
pole above its horizon plane.

An observer who travels north or south over the earth changes his
latitude, and therefore changes the angle between his horizon plane and
the axis of the earth. What effect will this have upon the position of
stars in his sky? If you were to go to the earth's equator, in what part
of the sky would you look for Polaris? Can Polaris be seen from
Australia? From South America? If you were to go from Minnesota to
Texas, in what respect would the appearance of stars in the northern sky
be changed? How would the appearance of stars in the southern sky be
changed?

[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diurnal path of Polaris.]

EXERCISE 8.--Determine your latitude by taking the altitude of Polaris
when it is at some one of the four points of its diurnal path, shown in
Fig. 12. When it is at _1_ it is said to be at upper culmination, and
the star ζ Ursæ Majoris in the handle of the Big Dipper will be
directly below it. When at _2_ it is at western elongation, and the star
Castor is near the meridian. When it is at _3_ it is at lower
culmination, and the star Spica is on the meridian. When it is at _4_ it
is at eastern elongation, and Altair is near the meridian. All of these
stars are conspicuous ones, which the student should find upon the map
and learn to recognize in the sky. The altitude observed at either _2_
or _4_ may be considered equal to the latitude of the place, but the
altitude observed when Polaris is at the positions marked _1_ and _3_
must be corrected for the star's distance from the pole, which may be
assumed equal to 1.3°.

The plumb-line apparatus described at page 12 is shown in Fig. 6
slightly modified, so as to adapt it to measuring the altitudes of
stars. Note that the board with the screw eye at one end has been
transferred from the box to the vertical standard, and has a screw eye
at each end. When the apparatus has been properly leveled, so that the
plumb line hangs at the middle of the hole in the box cover, the board
is to be pointed at the star by sighting through the centers of the two
screw eyes, and a pencil line is to be ruled along its edge upon the
face of the vertical standard. After this has been done turn the
apparatus halfway around so that what was the north side now points
south, level it again and revolve the board about the screw which holds
it to the vertical standard, until the screw eyes again point to the
star. Rule another line along the same edge of the board as before and
with a protractor measure the angle between these lines. Use a bicycle
lamp if you need artificial light for your work. The student who has
studied plane geometry should be able to prove that one half of the
angle between these lines is equal to the altitude of the star.

After you have determined your latitude from Polaris, compare the result
with your position as shown upon the best map available. With a little
practice and considerable care the latitude may be thus determined
within one tenth of a degree, which is equivalent to about 7 miles. If
you go 10 miles north or south from your first station you should find
the pole higher up or lower down in the sky by an amount which can be
measured with your apparatus.

19. THE MERIDIAN LINE.--To establish a true north and south line upon
the ground, use the apparatus as described at page 13, and when Polaris
is at upper or lower culmination drive into the ground two stakes in
line with the star and the plumb line. Such a meridian line is of great
convenience in observing the stars and should be laid out and
permanently marked in some convenient open space from which, if
possible, all parts of the sky are visible. June and November are
convenient months for this exercise, since Polaris then comes to
culmination early in the evening.

20. TIME.--What is _the time_ at which school begins in the morning?
What do you mean by "_the time_"?

The sidereal time at any moment is the right ascension of the hour
circle which at that moment coincides with the meridian. When the hour
circle passing through Sirius coincides with the meridian, the sidereal
time is 6h. 40m., since that is the right ascension of Sirius, and in
astronomical language Sirius is "_on the meridian_" at 6h. 40m. sidereal
time. As may be seen from the map, this 6h. 40m. is the right ascension
of Sirius, and if a clock be set to indicate 6h. 40m. when Sirius
crosses the meridian, it will show sidereal time. If the clock is
properly regulated, every other star in the heavens will come to the
meridian at the moment when the time shown by the clock is equal to the
right ascension of the star. A clock properly regulated for this purpose
will gain about four minutes per day in comparison with ordinary clocks,
and when so regulated it is called a sidereal clock. The student should
be provided with such a clock for his future work, but one such clock
will serve for several persons, and a nutmeg clock or a watch of the
cheapest kind is quite sufficient.

[Illustration: THE HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, CAMBRIDGE, MASS.]

EXERCISE 9.--Set such a clock to sidereal time by means of the transit
of a star over your meridian. For this experiment it is presupposed that
a meridian line has been marked out on the ground as in § 19, and the
simplest mode of performing the experiment required is for the observer,
having chosen a suitable star in the southern part of the sky, to place
his eye accurately over the northern end of the meridian line and to
estimate as nearly as possible the beginning and end of the period
during which the star appears to stand exactly above the southern end of
the line. The middle of this period may be taken as the time at which
the star crossed the meridian and at this moment the sidereal time is
equal to the right ascension of the star. The difference between this
right ascension and the observed middle instant is the error of the
clock or the amount by which its hands must be set back or forward in
order to indicate true sidereal time.

A more accurate mode of performing the experiment consists in using the
plumb-line apparatus carefully adjusted, as in Fig. 7, so that the line
joining the wire to the center of the screw eye shall be parallel to the
meridian line. Observe the time by the clock at which the star
disappears behind the wire as seen through the center of the screw eye.
If the star is too high up in the sky for convenient observation, place
a mirror, face up, just north of the screw eye and observe star, wire
and screw eye by reflection in it.

The numerical right ascension of the observed star is needed for this
experiment, and it may be measured from the star map, but it will
usually be best to observe one of the stars of the table at the end of
the book, and to obtain its right ascension as follows: The table gives
the right ascension and declination of each star as they were at the
beginning of the year 1900, but on account of the precession (see
Chapter V), these numbers all change slowly with the lapse of time, and
on the average the right ascension of each star of the table must be
increased by one twentieth of a minute for each year after 1900--i. e.,
in 1910 the right ascension of the first star of the table will be
0h. 38.6m. + (10/20)m. = 0h. 39.1m. The declinations also change
slightly, but as they are only intended to help in finding the star on
the star maps, their change may be ignored.

Having set the clock approximately to sidereal time, observe one or two
more stars in the same way as above. The difference between the observed
time and the right ascension, if any is found, is the "correction" of
the clock. This correction ought not to exceed a minute if due care has
been taken in the several operations prescribed. The relation of the
clock to the right ascension of the stars is expressed in the following
equation, with which the student should become thoroughly familiar:

    A = T ± U

_T_ stands for the time by the clock at which the star crossed the
meridian. _A_ is the right ascension of the star, and _U_ is the
correction of the clock. Use the + sign in the equation whenever the
clock is too slow, and the - sign when it is too fast. _U_ may be found
from this equation when _A_ and _T_ are given, or _A_ may be found when
_T_ and _U_ are given. It is in this way that astronomers measure the
right ascensions of the stars and planets.

Determine _U_ from each star you have observed, and note how the several
results agree one with another.

21. DEFINITIONS.--To define a thing or an idea is to give a description
sufficient to identify it and distinguish it from every other possible
thing or idea. If a definition does not come up to this standard it is
insufficient. Anything beyond this requirement is certainly useless and
probably mischievous.

Let the student define the following geographical terms, and let him
also criticise the definitions offered by his fellow-students: Equator,
poles, meridian, latitude, longitude, north, south, east, west.

Compare the following astronomical definitions with your geographical
definitions, and criticise them in the same way. If you are not able to
improve upon them, commit them to memory:

_The Poles_ of the heavens are those points in the sky toward which the
earth's axis points. How many are there? The one near Polaris is called
the north pole.

_The Celestial Equator_ is a great circle of the sky distant 90° from
the poles.

_The Zenith_ is that point of the sky, overhead, toward which a plumb
line points. Why is the word overhead placed in the definition? Is there
more than one zenith?

_The Horizon_ is a great circle of the sky 90° distant from the zenith.

_An Hour Circle_ is any great circle of the sky which passes through the
poles. Every star has its own hour circle.

_The Meridian_ is that hour circle which passes through the zenith.

_A Vertical Circle_ is any great circle that passes through the zenith.
Is the meridian a vertical circle?

_The Declination_ of a star is its angular distance north or south of
the celestial equator.

_The Right Ascension_ of a star is the angle included between its hour
circle and the hour circle of a certain point on the equator which is
called the _Vernal Equinox_. From spherical geometry we learn that this
angle is to be measured either at the pole where the two hour circles
intersect, as is done in the star map opposite page 124, or along the
equator, as is done in the map opposite page 190. Right ascension is
always measured from the vernal equinox in the direction opposite to
that in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e.,
from west toward east.

_The Altitude_ of a star is its angular distance above the horizon.

_The Azimuth_ of a star is the angle between the meridian and the
vertical circle passing through the star. A star due south has an
azimuth of 0°. Due west, 90°. Due north, 180°. Due east, 270°.

What is the azimuth of Polaris in degrees?

What is the azimuth of the sun at sunrise? At sunset? At noon? Are these
azimuths the same on different days?

_The Hour Angle_ of a star is the angle between its hour circle and the
meridian. It is measured from the meridian in the direction in which the
stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from east toward
west.

What is the hour angle of the sun at noon? What is the hour angle of
Polaris when it is at the lowest point in its daily motion?

22. EXERCISES.--The student must not be satisfied with merely learning
these definitions. He must learn to see these points and lines in his
mind as if they were visibly painted upon the sky. To this end it will
help him to note that the poles, the zenith, the meridian, the horizon,
and the equator seem to stand still in the sky, always in the same place
with respect to the observer, while the hour circles and the vernal
equinox move with the stars and keep the same place among them. Does the
apparent motion of a star change its declination or right ascension?
What is the hour angle of the sun when it has the greatest altitude?
Will your answer to the preceding question be true for a star? What is
the altitude of the sun after sunset? In what direction is the north
pole from the zenith? From the vernal equinox? Where are the points in
which the meridian and equator respectively intersect the horizon?




CHAPTER III

FIXED AND WANDERING STARS


23. STAR MAPS.--Select from the map some conspicuous constellation that
will be conveniently placed for observation in the evening, and make on
a large scale a copy of all the stars of the constellation that are
shown upon the map. At night compare this copy with the sky, and mark in
upon your paper all the stars of the constellation which are not already
there. Both the original drawing and the additions made to it by night
should be carefully done, and for the latter purpose what is called the
method of allineations may be used with advantage--i. e., the new star
is in line with two already on the drawing and is midway between them,
or it makes an equilateral triangle with two others, or a square with
three others, etc.

A series of maps of the more prominent constellations, such as Ursa
Major, Cassiopea, Pegasus, Taurus, Orion, Gemini, Canis Major, Leo,
Corvus, Bootes, Virgo, Hercules, Lyra, Aquila, Scorpius, should be
constructed in this manner upon a uniform scale and preserved as a part
of the student's work. Let the magnitude of the stars be represented on
the maps as accurately as may be, and note the peculiarity of color
which some stars present. For the most part their color is a very pale
yellow, but occasionally one may be found of a decidedly ruddy
hue--e. g., Aldebaran or Antares. Such a star map, not quite complete,
is shown in Fig. 13.

So, too, a sharp eye may detect that some stars do not remain always of
the same magnitude, but change their brightness from night to night,
and this not on account of cloud or mist in the atmosphere, but from
something in the star itself. Algol is one of the most conspicuous of
these _variable stars_, as they are called.

[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Star map of the region about Orion.]

24. THE MOON'S MOTION AMONG THE STARS.--Whenever the moon is visible
note its position among the stars by allineations, and plot it on the
key map opposite page 190. Keep a record of the day and hour
corresponding to each such observation. You will find, if the work is
correctly done, that the positions of the moon all fall near the curved
line shown on the map. This line is called the ecliptic.

After several such observations have been made and plotted, find by
measurement from the map how many degrees per day the moon moves. How
long would it require to make the circuit of the heavens and come back
to the starting point?

On each night when you observe the moon, make on a separate piece of
paper a drawing of it about 10 centimeters in diameter and show in the
drawing every feature of the moon's face which you can see--e. g., the
shape of the illuminated surface (phase); the direction among the stars
of the line joining the horns; any spots which you can see upon the
moon's face, etc. An opera glass will prove of great assistance in this
work.

Use your drawings and the positions of the moon plotted upon the map to
answer the following questions: Does the direction of the line joining
the horns have any special relation to the ecliptic? Does the amount of
illuminated surface of the moon have any relation to the moon's angular
distance from the sun? Does it have any relation to the time at which
the moon sets? Do the spots on the moon when visible remain always in
the same place? Do they come and go? Do they change their position with
relation to each other? Can you determine from these spots that the moon
rotates about an axis, as the earth does? In what direction does its
axis point? How long does it take to make one revolution about the axis?
Is there any day and night upon the moon?

Each of these questions can be correctly answered from the student's own
observations without recourse to any book.

25. THE SUN AND ITS MOTION.--Examine the face of the sun through a
smoked glass to see if there is anything there that you can sketch.

By day as well as by night the sky is studded with stars, only they can
not be seen by day on account of the overwhelming glare of sunlight, but
the position of the sun among the stars may be found quite as
accurately as was that of the moon, by observing from day to day its
right ascension and declination, and this should be practiced at noon on
clear days by different members of the class.

EXERCISE 10.--The right ascension of the sun may be found by observing
with the sidereal clock the time of its transit over the meridian. Use
the equation in § 20, and substitute in place of _U_ the value of the
clock correction found from observations of stars on a preceding or
following night. If the clock gains or loses _with respect to sidereal
time_, take this into account in the value of _U_.

EXERCISE 11.--To determine the sun's declination, measure its altitude
at the time it crosses the meridian. Use either the method of Exercise
4, or that used with Polaris in Exercise 8. The student should be able
to show from Fig. 11 that the declination is equal to the sum of the
altitude and the latitude of the place diminished by 90°, or in an
equation

    Declination = Altitude + Latitude - 90°.

If the declination as found from this equation is a negative number it
indicates that the sun is on the south side of the equator.

The right ascension and declination of the sun as observed on each day
should be plotted on the map and the date, written opposite it. If the
work has been correctly done, the plotted points should fall upon the
curved line (ecliptic) which runs lengthwise of the map. This line, in
fact, represents the sun's path among the stars.

Note that the hours of right ascension increase from 0 up to 24, while
the numbers on the clock dial go only from 0 to 12, and then repeat 0 to
12 again during the same day. When the sidereal time is 13 hours, 14
hours, etc., the clock will indicate 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., and 12 hours
must then be added to the time shown on the dial.

If observations of the sun's right ascension and declination are made
in the latter part of either March or September the student will find
that the sun crosses the equator at these times, and he should determine
from his observations, as accurately as possible, the date and hour of
this crossing and the point on the equator at which the sun crosses it.
These points are called the equinoxes, Vernal Equinox and Autumnal
Equinox for the spring and autumn crossings respectively, and the
student will recall that the vernal equinox is the point from which
right ascensions are measured. Its position among the stars is found by
astronomers from observations like those above described, only made with
much more elaborate apparatus.

Similar observations made in June and December show that the sun's
midday altitude is about 47° greater in summer than in winter. They show
also that the sun is as far north of the equator in June as he is south
of it in December, from which it is easily inferred that his path, the
ecliptic, is inclined to the equator at an angle of 23°.5, one half of
47°. This angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. The student may
recall that in the geographies the torrid zone is said to extend 23°.5
on either side of the earth's equator. Is there any connection between
these limits and the obliquity of the ecliptic? Would it be correct to
define the torrid zone as that part of the earth's surface within which
the sun may at some season of the year pass through the zenith?

EXERCISE 12.--After a half dozen observations of the sun have been
plotted upon the map, find by measurement the rate, in degrees per day,
at which the sun moves along the ecliptic. How many days will be
required for it to move completely around the ecliptic from vernal
equinox back to vernal equinox again? Accurate observations with the
elaborate apparatus used by professional astronomers show that this
period, which is called a _tropical year_, is 365 days 5 hours 48
minutes 46 seconds. Is this the same as the ordinary year of our
calendars?

26. THE PLANETS.--Any one who has watched the sky and who has made the
drawings prescribed in this chapter can hardly fail to have found in the
course of his observations some bright stars not set down on the printed
star maps, and to have found also that these stars do not remain fixed
in position among their fellows, but wander about from one constellation
to another. Observe the motion of one of these planets from night to
night and plot its positions on the star map, precisely as was done for
the moon. What kind of path does it follow?

Both the ancient Greeks and the modern Germans have called these bodies
wandering stars, and in English we name them planets, which is simply
the Greek word for wanderer, bent to our use. Besides the sun and moon
there are in the heavens five planets easily visible to the naked eye
and, as we shall see later, a great number of smaller ones visible only
in the telescope. More than 2,000 years ago astronomers began observing
the motion of sun, moon, and planets among the stars, and endeavored to
account for these motions by the theory that each wandering star moved
in an orbit about the earth. Classical and mediæval literature are
permeated with this idea, which was displaced only after a long struggle
begun by Copernicus (1543 A. D.), who taught that the moon alone of
these bodies revolves about the earth, while the earth and the other
planets revolve around the sun. The ecliptic is the intersection of the
plane of the earth's orbit with the sky, and the sun appears to move
along the ecliptic because, as the earth moves around its orbit, the sun
is always seen projected against the opposite side of it. The moon and
planets all appear to move near the ecliptic because the planes of their
orbits nearly coincide with the plane of the earth's orbit, and a narrow
strip on either side of the ecliptic, following its course completely
around the sky, is called the _zodiac_, a word which may be regarded as
the name of a narrow street (16° wide) within which all the wanderings
of the visible planets are confined and outside of which they never
venture. Indeed, Mars is the only planet which ever approaches the edge
of the street, the others traveling near the middle of the road.

[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The apparent motion of a planet.]

27. A TYPICAL CASE OF PLANETARY MOTION.--The Copernican theory,
enormously extended and developed through the Newtonian law of
gravitation (see Chapter IV), has completely supplanted the older
Ptolemaic doctrine, and an illustration of the simple manner in which it
accounts for the apparently complicated motions of a planet among the
stars is found in Figs. 14 and 15, the first of which represents the
apparent motion of the planet Mars through the constellations Aries and
Pisces during the latter part of the year 1894, while the second shows
the true motions of Mars and the earth in their orbits about the sun
during the same period. The straight line in Fig. 14, with cross ruling
upon it, is a part of the ecliptic, and the numbers placed opposite it
represent the distance, in degrees, from the vernal equinox. In Fig. 15
the straight line represents the direction from the sun toward the
vernal equinox, and the angle which this line makes with the line
joining earth and sun is called the earth's longitude. The imaginary
line joining the earth and sun is called the earth's radius vector, and
the pupil should note that the longitude and length of the radius vector
taken together show the direction and distance of the earth from the
sun--i. e., they fix the relative positions of the two bodies. The same
is nearly true for Mars and would be wholly true if the orbit of Mars
lay in the same plane with that of the earth. How does Fig. 14 show that
the orbit of Mars does not lie exactly in the same plane with the orbit
of the earth?

EXERCISE 13.--Find from Fig. 15 what ought to have been the apparent
course of Mars among the stars during the period shown in the two
figures, and compare what you find with Fig. 14. The apparent position
of Mars among the stars is merely its direction from the earth, and this
direction is represented in Fig. 14 by the distance of the planet from
the ecliptic and by its longitude.

[Illustration: FIG. 15.--The real motion of a planet.]

The longitude of Mars for each date can be found from Fig. 15 by
measuring the angle between the straight line _S V_ and the line drawn
from the earth to Mars. Thus for October 12th we may find with the
protractor that the angle between the line _S V_ and the line joining
the earth to Mars is a little more than 30°, and in Fig. 14 the position
of Mars for this date is shown nearly opposite the cross line
corresponding to 30° on the ecliptic. Just how far below the ecliptic
this position of Mars should fall can not be told from Fig. 15, which
from necessity is constructed as if the orbits of Mars and the earth lay
in the same plane, and Mars in this case would always appear to stand
exactly on the ecliptic and to oscillate back and forth as shown in Fig.
14, but without the up-and-down motion there shown. In this way plot in
Fig. 14 the longitudes of Mars as seen from the earth for other dates
and observe how the forward motion of the two planets in their orbits
accounts for the apparently capricious motion of Mars to and fro among
the stars.

[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.]

28. THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS.--Each planet, great or small, moves in
its own appropriate orbit about the sun, and the exact determination of
these orbits, their sizes, shapes, positions, etc., has been one of the
great problems of astronomy for more than 2,000 years, in which
successive generations of astronomers have striven to push to a still
higher degree of accuracy the knowledge attained by their predecessors.
Without attempting to enter into the details of this problem we may say,
generally, that every planet moves in a plane passing through the sun,
and for the six planets visible to the naked eye these planes nearly
coincide, so that the six orbits may all be shown without much error as
lying in the flat surface of one map. It is, however, more convenient to
use two maps, such as Figs. 16 and 17, one of which shows the group of
planets, Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Mars, which are near the sun,
and on this account are sometimes called the inner planets, while the
other shows the more distant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, together with
the earth, whose orbit is thus made to serve as a connecting link
between the two diagrams. These diagrams are accurately drawn to scale,
and are intended to be used by the student for accurate measurement in
connection with the exercises and problems which follow.

In addition to the six planets shown in the figures the solar system
contains two large planets and several hundred small ones, for the most
part invisible to the naked eye, which are omitted in order to avoid
confusing the diagrams.

29. JUPITER AND SATURN.--In Fig. 16 the sun at the center is encircled
by the orbits of the three planets, and inclosing all of these is a
circular border showing the directions from the sun of the
constellations which lie along the zodiac. The student must note
carefully that it is only the directions of these constellations that
are correctly shown, and that in order to show them at all they have
been placed very much too close to the sun. The cross lines extending
from the orbit of the earth toward the sun with Roman numerals opposite
them show the positions of the earth in its orbit on the first day of
January (_I_), first day of February (_II_), etc., and the similar lines
attached to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn with Arabic numerals show
the positions of those planets on the first day of January of each year
indicated, so that the figure serves to show not only the orbits of the
planets, but their actual positions in their orbits for something more
than the first decade of the twentieth century.

The line drawn from the sun toward the right of the figure shows the
direction to the vernal equinox. It forms one side of the angle which
measures a planet's longitude.

[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The orbits of the inner planets.]

EXERCISE 14.--Measure with your protractor the longitude of the earth on
January 1st. Is this longitude the same in all years? Measure the
longitude of Jupiter on January 1, 1900; on July 1, 1900; on September
25, 1906.

Draw neatly on the map a pencil line connecting the position of the
earth for January 1, 1900, with the position of Jupiter for the same
date, and produce the line beyond Jupiter until it meets the circle of
the constellations. This line represents the direction of Jupiter from
the earth, and points toward the constellation in which the planet
appears at that date. But this representation of the place of Jupiter in
the sky is not a very accurate one, since on the scale of the diagram
the stars are in fact more than 100,000 times as far off as they are
shown in the figure, and the pencil mark does not meet the line of
constellations at the same intersection it would have if this line were
pushed back to its true position. To remedy this defect we must draw
another line from the sun parallel to the one first drawn, and its
intersection with the constellations will give very approximately the
true position of Jupiter in the sky.

EXERCISE 15.--Find the present positions of Jupiter and Saturn, and look
them up in the sky by means of your star maps. The planets will appear
in the indicated constellations as very bright stars not shown on the
map.

Which of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn, changes its direction from the
sun more rapidly? Which travels the greater number of miles per day?
When will Jupiter and Saturn be in the same constellation? Does the
earth move faster or slower than Jupiter?

The distance of Jupiter or Saturn from the earth at any time may be
readily obtained from the figure. Thus, by direct measurement with the
millimeter scale we find for January 1, 1900, the distance of Jupiter
from the earth is 6.1 times the distance of the sun from the earth, and
this may be turned into miles by multiplying it by 93,000,000, which is
approximately the distance of the sun from the earth. For most purposes
it is quite as well to dispense with this multiplication and call the
distance 6.1 astronomical units, remembering that the astronomical unit
is the distance of the sun from the earth.

EXERCISE 16.--What is Jupiter's distance from the earth at its nearest
approach? What is the greatest distance it ever attains? Is Jupiter's
least distance from the earth greater or less than its least distance
from Saturn?

On what day in the year 1906 will the earth be on line between Jupiter
and the sun? On this day Jupiter is said to be in _opposition_--i. e.,
the planet and the sun are on opposite sides of the earth, and Jupiter
then comes to the meridian of any and every place at midnight. When the
sun is between the earth and Jupiter (at what date in 1906?) the planet
is said to be in _conjunction_ with the sun, and of course passes the
meridian with the sun at noon. Can you determine from the figure the
time at which Jupiter comes to the meridian at other dates than
opposition and conjunction? Can you determine when it is visible in the
evening hours? Tell from the figure what constellation is on the
meridian at midnight on January 1st. Will it be the same constellation
in every year?


30. MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS.--Fig. 17, which represents the orbits of
the inner planets, differs from Fig. 16 only in the method of fixing the
positions of the planets in their orbits at any given date. The motion
of these planets is so rapid, on account of their proximity to the sun,
that it would not do to mark their positions as was done for Jupiter and
Saturn, and with the exception of the earth they do not always return to
the same place on the same day in each year. It is therefore necessary
to adopt a slightly different method, as follows: The straight line
extending from the sun toward the vernal equinox, _V_, is called the
prime radius, and we know from past observations that the earth in its
motion around the sun crosses this line on September 23d in each year,
and to fix the earth's position for September 23d in the diagram we have
only to take the point at which the prime radius intersects the earth's
orbit. A month later, on October 23d, the earth will no longer be at
this point, but will have moved on along its orbit to the point marked
30 (thirty days after September 23d). Sixty days after September 23d it
will be at the point marked 60, etc., and for any date we have only to
find the number of days intervening between it and the preceding
September 23d, and this number will show at once the position of the
earth in its orbit. Thus for the date July 4, 1900, we find

    1900, July 4 - 1899, September 23 = 284 days,

and the little circle marked upon the earth's orbit between the numbers
270 and 300 shows the position of the earth on that date.

In what constellation was the sun on July 4, 1900? What zodiacal
constellation came to the meridian at midnight on that date? What other
constellations came to the meridian at the same time?

The positions of the other planets in their orbits are found in the same
manner, save that they do not cross the prime radius on the same date in
each year, and the times at which they do cross it must be taken from
the following table:

                      TABLE OF EPOCHS

  -----------------------------------------------------------

The first line of figures in this table shows the number of days that
each of these planets requires to make a complete revolution about the
sun, and it appears from these numbers that Mercury makes about four
revolutions in its orbit per year, and therefore crosses the prime
radius four times in each year, while the other planets are decidedly
slower in their movements. The following lines of the table show for
each year the date at which each planet first crossed the prime radius
in that year; the dates of subsequent crossings in any year can be found
by adding once, twice, or three times the period to the given date, and
the table may be extended to later years, if need be, by continuously
adding multiples of the period. In the case of Mars it appears that
there is only about one year out of two in which this planet crosses the
prime radius.

After the date at which the planet crosses the prime radius has been
determined its position for any required date is found exactly as in the
case of the earth, and the constellation in which the planet will appear
from the earth is found as explained above in connection with Jupiter
and Saturn.

The broken lines in the figure represent the construction for finding
the places in the sky occupied by Mercury, Venus, and Mars on July 4,
1900. Let the student make a similar construction and find the positions
of these planets at the present time. Look them up in the sky and see if
they are where your work puts them.

31. EXERCISES.--The "evening star" is a term loosely applied to any
planet which is visible in the western sky soon after sunset. It is easy
to see that such a planet must be farther toward the east in the sky
than is the sun, and in either Fig. 16 or Fig. 17 any planet which
viewed from the position of the earth lies to the left of the sun and
not more than 50° away from it will be an evening star. If to the right
of the sun it is a morning star, and may be seen in the eastern sky
shortly before sunrise.

What planet is the evening star _now_? Is there more than one evening
star at a time? What is the morning star now?

Do Mercury, Venus, or Mars ever appear in opposition? What is the
maximum angular distance from the sun at which Venus can ever be seen?
Why is Mercury a more difficult planet to see than Venus? In what month
of the year does Mars come nearest to the earth? Will it always be
brighter in this month than in any other? Which of all the planets comes
nearest to the earth?

The earth always comes to the same longitude on the same day of each
year. Why is not this true of the other planets?

The student should remember that in one respect Figs. 16 and 17 are not
altogether correct representations, since they show the orbits as all
lying in the same plane. If this were strictly true, every planet would
move, like the sun, always along the ecliptic; but in fact all of the
orbits are tilted a little out of the plane of the ecliptic and every
planet in its motion deviates a little from the ecliptic, first to one
side then to the other; but not even Mars, which is the most erratic in
this respect, ever gets more than eight degrees away from the ecliptic,
and for the most part all of them are much closer to the ecliptic than
this limit.




CHAPTER IV

CELESTIAL MECHANICS


32. THE BEGINNINGS OF CELESTIAL MECHANICS.--From the earliest dawn of
civilization, long before the beginnings of written history, the motions
of sun and moon and planets among the stars from constellation to
constellation had commanded the attention of thinking men, particularly
of the class of priests. The religions of which they were the guardians
and teachers stood in closest relations with the movements of the stars,
and their own power and influence were increased by a knowledge of them.

[Illustration: ISAAC NEWTON (1643-1727).]

Out of these professional needs, as well as from a spirit of scientific
research, there grew up and flourished for many centuries a study of the
motions of the planets, simple and crude at first, because the
observations that could then be made were at best but rough ones, but
growing more accurate and more complex as the development of the
mechanic arts put better and more precise instruments into the hands of
astronomers and enabled them to observe with increasing accuracy the
movements of these bodies. It was early seen that while for the most
part the planets, including the sun and moon, traveled through the
constellations from west to east, some of them sometimes reversed their
motion and for a time traveled in the opposite way. This clearly can not
be explained by the simple theory which had early been adopted that a
planet moves always in the same direction around a circular orbit having
the earth at its center, and so it was said to move around in a small
circular orbit, called an epicycle, whose center was situated upon
and moved along a circular orbit, called the deferent, within which the
earth was placed, as is shown in Fig. 18, where the small circle is the
epicycle, the large circle is the deferent, _P_ is the planet, and _E_
the earth. When this proved inadequate to account for the really
complicated movements of the planets, another epicycle was put on top of
the first one, and then another and another, until the supposed system
became so complicated that Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, repudiated
its fundamental theorem and taught that the motions of the planets take
place in circles around the sun instead of about the earth, and that the
earth itself is only one of the planets moving around the sun in its own
appropriate orbit and itself largely responsible for the seemingly
erratic movements of the other planets, since from day to day we see
them and observe their positions from different points of view.

[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Epicycle and deferent.]

33. KEPLER'S LAWS.--Two generations later came Kepler with his three
famous laws of planetary motion:

I. Every planet moves in an ellipse which has the sun at one of its
foci.

II. The radius vector of each planet moves over equal areas in equal
times.

III. The squares of the periodic times of the planets are proportional
to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.

These laws are the crowning glory, not only of Kepler's career, but of
all astronomical discovery from the beginning up to his time, and they
well deserve careful study and explanation, although more modern
progress has shown that they are only approximately true.

EXERCISE 17.--Drive two pins into a smooth board an inch apart and
fasten to them the ends of a string a foot long. Take up the slack of
the string with the point of a lead pencil and, keeping the string drawn
taut, move the pencil point over the board into every possible position.
The curve thus traced will be an ellipse having the pins at the two
points which are called its foci.

In the case of the planetary orbits one focus of the ellipse is vacant,
and, in accordance with the first law, the center of the sun is at the
other focus. In Fig. 17 the dot, inside the orbit of Mercury, which is
marked _a_, shows the position of the vacant focus of the orbit of Mars,
and the dot _b_ is the vacant focus of Mercury's orbit. The orbits of
Venus and the earth are so nearly circular that their vacant foci lie
very close to the sun and are not marked in the figure. The line drawn
from the sun to any point of the orbit (the string from pin to pencil
point) is a _radius vector_. The point midway between the pins is the
_center_ of the ellipse, and the distance of either pin from the center
measures the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse.

Draw several ellipses with the same length of string, but with the pins
at different distances apart, and note that the greater the eccentricity
the flatter is the ellipse, but that all of them have the same length.

If both pins were driven into the same hole, what kind of an ellipse
would you get?

The Second Law was worked out by Kepler as his answer to a problem
suggested by the first law. In Fig. 17 it is apparent from a mere
inspection of the orbit of Mercury that this planet travels much faster
on one side of its orbit than on the other, the distance covered in ten
days between the numbers 10 and 20 being more than fifty per cent
greater than that between 50 and 60. The same difference is found,
though usually in less degree, for every other planet, and Kepler's
problem was to discover a means by which to mark upon the orbit the
figures showing the positions of the planet at the end of equal
intervals of time. His solution of this problem, contained in the second
law, asserts that if we draw radii vectors from the sun to each of the
marked points taken at equal time intervals around the orbit, then the
area of the sector formed by two adjacent radii vectores and the arc
included between them is equal to the area of each and every other such
sector, the short radii vectores being spread apart so as to include a
long arc between them while the long radii vectores have a short arc. In
Kepler's form of stating the law the radius vector is supposed to travel
with the planet and in each day to sweep over the same fractional part
of the total area of the orbit. The spacing of the numbers in Fig. 17
was done by means of this law.

For the proper understanding of Kepler's Third Law we must note that the
"mean distance" which appears in it is one half of the long diameter of
the orbit and that the "periodic time" means the number of days or years
required by the planet to make a complete circuit in its orbit.
Representing the first of these by _a_ and the second by _T_, we have,
as the mathematical equivalent of the law,

    a^{3} ÷ T^{2} = C

where the quotient, _C_, is a number which, as Kepler found, is the same
for every planet of the solar system. If we take the mean distance of
the earth from the sun as the unit of distance, and the year as the unit
of time, we shall find by applying the equation to the earth's motion,
_C_ = 1. Applying this value to any other planet we shall find in the
same units, _a_ = _T_^{2/3}, by means of which we may determine the
distance of any planet from the sun when its periodic time, _T_, has
been learned from observation.

EXERCISE 18.--Uranus requires 84 years to make a revolution in its
orbit. What is its mean distance from the sun? What are the mean
distances of Mercury, Venus, and Mars? (See Chapter III for their
periodic times.) Would it be possible for two planets at different
distances from the sun to move around their orbits in the same time?

A circle is an ellipse in which the two foci have been brought together.
Would Kepler's laws hold true for such an orbit?

34. NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION.--Kepler studied and described the motion of
the planets. Newton, three generations later (1727 A. D.), studied and
described the mechanism which controls that motion. To Kepler and his
age the heavens were supernatural, while to Newton and his successors
they are a part of Nature, governed by the same laws which obtain upon
the earth, and we turn to the ordinary things of everyday life as the
foundation of celestial mechanics.

Every one who has ridden a bicycle knows that he can coast farther upon
a level road if it is smooth than if it is rough; but however smooth and
hard the road may be and however fast the wheel may have been started,
it is sooner or later stopped by the resistance which the road and the
air offer to its motion, and when once stopped or checked it can be
started again only by applying fresh power. We have here a familiar
illustration of what is called

THE FIRST LAW OF MOTION.--"Every body continues in its state of rest or
of uniform motion in a straight line except in so far as it may be
compelled by force to change that state." A gust of wind, a stone, a
careless movement of the rider may turn the bicycle to the right or the
left, but unless some disturbing force is applied it will go straight
ahead, and if all resistance to its motion could be removed it would go
always at the speed given it by the last power applied, swerving neither
to the one hand nor the other.

When a slow rider increases his speed we recognize at once that he has
applied additional power to the wheel, and when this speed is slackened
it equally shows that force has been applied against the motion. It is
force alone which can produce a change in either velocity or direction
of motion; but simple as this law now appears it required the genius of
Galileo to discover it and of Newton to give it the form in which it is
stated above.

35. THE SECOND LAW OF MOTION, which is also due to Galileo and Newton,
is:

"Change of motion is proportional to force applied and takes place in
the direction of the straight line in which the force acts." Suppose a
man to fall from a balloon at some great elevation in the air; his own
weight is the force which pulls him down, and that force operating at
every instant is sufficient to give him at the end of the first second
of his fall a downward velocity of 32 feet per second--i. e., it has
changed his state from rest, to motion at this rate, and the motion is
toward the earth because the force acts in that direction. During the
next second the ceaseless operation of this force will have the same
effect as in the first second and will add another 32 feet to his
velocity, so that two seconds from the time he commenced to fall he will
be moving at the rate of 64 feet per second, etc. The column of figures
marked _v_ in the table below shows what his velocity will be at the end
of subsequent seconds. The changing velocity here shown is the change of
motion to which the law refers, and the velocity is proportional to the
time shown in the first column of the table, because the amount of force
exerted in this case is proportional to the time during which it
operated. The distance through which the man will fall in each second is
shown in the column marked _d_, and is found by taking the average of
his velocity at the beginning and end of this second, and the total
distance through which he has fallen at the end of each second, marked
_s_ in the table, is found by taking the sum of all the preceding values
of _d_. The velocity, 32 feet per second, which measures the change of
motion in each second, also measures the _accelerating force_ which
produces this motion, and it is usually represented in formulæ by the
letter _g_. Let the student show from the numbers in the table that the
accelerating force, the time, _t_, during which it operates, and the
space, _s_, fallen through, satisfy the relation

    s = 1/2 gt^{2},

which is usually called the law of falling bodies. How does the table
show that _g_ is equal to 32?

            TABLE

If the balloon were half a mile high how long would it take to fall to
the ground? What would be the velocity just before reaching the ground?

[Illustration: GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642).]

Fig. 19 shows the path through the air of a ball which has been struck
by a bat at the point _A_, and started off in the direction _A B_ with a
velocity of 200 feet per second. In accordance with the first law of
motion, if it were acted upon by no other force than the impulse given
by the bat, it should travel along the straight line _A B_ at the
uniform rate of 200 feet per second, and at the end of the fourth second
it should be 800 feet from _A_, at the point marked 4, but during these
four seconds its weight has caused it to fall 256 feet, and its actual
position, 4', is 256 feet below the point 4. In this way we find its
position at the end of each second, 1', 2', 3', 4', etc., and drawing a
line through these points we shall find the actual path of the ball
under the influence of the two forces to be the curved line _A C_. No
matter how far the ball may go before striking the ground, it can not
get back to the point _A_, and the curve _A C_ therefore can not be a
part of a circle, since that curve returns into itself. It is, in fact,
a part of a _parabola_, which, as we shall see later, is a kind of orbit
in which comets and some other heavenly bodies move. A skyrocket moves
in the same kind of a path, and so does a stone, a bullet, or any other
object hurled through the air.

[Illustration: FIG. 19.--The path of a ball.]

36. THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION.--"To every action there is always an equal
and contrary reaction; or the mutual actions of any two bodies are
always equal and oppositely directed." This is well illustrated in the
case of a man climbing a rope hand over hand. The direct force or action
which he exerts is a downward pull upon the rope, and it is the reaction
of the rope to this pull which lifts him along it. We shall find in a
later chapter a curious application of this law to the history of the
earth and moon.

It is the great glory of Sir Isaac Newton that he first of all men
recognized that these simple laws of motion hold true in the heavens as
well as upon the earth; that the complicated motion of a planet, a
comet, or a star is determined in accordance with these laws by the
forces which act upon the bodies, and that these forces are essentially
the same as that which we call weight. The formal statement of the
principle last named is included in--

37. NEWTON'S LAW OF GRAVITATION.--"Every particle of matter in the
universe attracts every other particle with a force whose direction is
that of a line joining the two, and whose magnitude is directly as the
product of their masses, and inversely as the square of their distance
from each other." We know that we ourselves and the things about us are
pulled toward the earth by a force (weight) which is called, in the
Latin that Newton wrote, _gravitas_, and the word marks well the true
significance of the law of gravitation. Newton did not discover a new
force in the heavens, but he extended an old and familiar one from a
limited terrestrial sphere of action to an unlimited and celestial one,
and furnished a precise statement of the way in which the force
operates. Whether a body be hot or cold, wet or dry, solid, liquid, or
gaseous, is of no account in determining the force which it exerts,
since this depends solely upon mass and distance.

The student should perhaps be warned against straining too far the
language which it is customary to employ in this connection. The law of
gravitation is certainly a far-reaching one, and it may operate in every
remotest corner of the universe precisely as stated above, but
additional information about those corners would be welcome to
supplement our rather scanty stock of knowledge concerning what happens
there. We may not controvert the words of a popular preacher who says,
"When I lift my hand I move the stars in Ursa Major," but we should not
wish to stand sponsor for them, even though they are justified by a
rigorous interpretation of the Newtonian law.

The word _mass_, in the statement of the law of gravitation, means the
quantity of matter contained in the body, and if we represent by the
letters _m´_ and _m´´_ the respective quantities of matter contained in
the two bodies whose distance from each other is _r_, we shall have, in
accordance with the law of gravitation, the following mathematical
expression for the force, _F_, which acts between them:

    F = k {m´m´´/r^{2}}.

This equation, which is the general mathematical expression for the law
of gravitation, may be made to yield some curious results. Thus, if we
select two bullets, each having a mass of 1 gram, and place them so that
their centers are 1 centimeter apart, the above expression for the force
exerted between them becomes

    F = k {(1 × 1)/1^{2}} = k,

from which it appears that the coefficient _k_ is the force exerted
between these bodies. This is called the gravitation constant, and it
evidently furnishes a measure of the specific intensity with which one
particle of matter attracts another. Elaborate experiments which have
been made to determine the amount of this force show that it is
surprisingly small, for in the case of the two bullets whose mass of 1
gram each is supposed to be concentrated into an indefinitely small
space, gravity would have to operate between them continuously for more
than forty minutes in order to pull them together, although they were
separated by only 1 centimeter to start with, and nothing save their own
inertia opposed their movements. It is only when one or both of the
masses _m´_, _m´´_ are very great that the force of gravity becomes
large, and the weight of bodies at the surface of the earth is
considerable because of the great quantity of matter which goes to make
up the earth. Many of the heavenly bodies are much more massive than the
earth, as the mathematical astronomers have found by applying the law of
gravitation to determine numerically their masses, or, in more popular
language, to "weigh" them.

The student should observe that the two terms mass and weight are not
synonymous; mass is defined above as the quantity of matter contained in
a body, while weight is the force with which the earth attracts that
body, and in accordance with the law of gravitation its weight depends
upon its distance from the center of the earth, while its mass is quite
independent of its position with respect to the earth.

By the third law of motion the earth is pulled toward a falling body
just as strongly as the body is pulled toward the earth--i. e., by a
force equal to the weight of the body. How much does the earth rise
toward the body?

38. THE MOTION OF A PLANET.--In Fig. 20 _S_ represents the sun and _P_ a
planet or other celestial body, which for the moment is moving along the
straight line _P 1_. In accordance with the first law of motion it would
continue to move along this line with uniform velocity if no external
force acted upon it; but such a force, the sun's attraction, is acting,
and by virtue of this attraction the body is pulled aside from the line
_P 1_.

Knowing the velocity and direction of the body's motion and the force
with which the sun attracts it, the mathematician is able to apply
Newton's laws of motion so as to determine the path of the body, and a
few of the possible orbits are shown in the figure where the short cross
stroke marks the point of each orbit which is nearest to the sun. This
point is called the _perihelion_.

Without any formal application of mathematics we may readily see that
the swifter the motion of the body at _P_ the shorter will be the time
during which it is subjected to the sun's attraction at close range, and
therefore the force exerted by the sun, and the resulting change of
motion, will be small, as in the orbits _P 1_ and _P 2_.

On the other hand, _P 5_ and _P 6_ represent orbits in which the
velocity at _P_ was comparatively small, and the resulting change of
motion greater than would be possible for a more swiftly moving body.

What would be the orbit if the velocity at _P_ were reduced to nothing
at all?

What would be the effect if the body starting at _P_ moved directly away
from _1_?

[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Different kinds of orbits.]

The student should not fail to observe that the sun's attraction tends
to pull the body at _P_ forward along its path, and therefore increases
its velocity, and that this influence continues until the planet reaches
perihelion, at which point it attains its greatest velocity, and the
force of the sun's attraction is wholly expended in changing the
direction of its motion. After the planet has passed perihelion the
sun begins to pull backward and to retard the motion in just the same
measure that before perihelion passage it increased it, so that the
two halves of the orbit on opposite sides of a line drawn from the
perihelion through the sun are exactly alike. We may here note the
explanation of Kepler's second law: when the planet is near the sun it
moves faster, and the radius vector changes its direction more rapidly
than when the planet is remote from the sun on account of the greater
force with which it is attracted, and the exact relation between the
rates at which the radius vector turns in different parts of the orbit,
as given by the second law, depends upon the changes in this force.

When the velocity is not too great, the sun's backward pull, after a
planet has passed perihelion, finally overcomes it and turns the planet
toward the sun again, in such a way that it comes back to the point _P_,
moving in the same direction and with the same speed as before--i. e.,
it has gone around the sun in an orbit like _P 6_ or _P 4_, an ellipse,
along which it will continue to move ever after. But we must not fail to
note that this return into the same orbit is a consequence of the last
line in the statement of the law of gravitation (p. 54), and that, if
the magnitude of this force were inversely as the cube of the distance
or any other proportion than the square, the orbit would be something
very different. If the velocity is too great for the sun's attraction to
overcome, the orbit will be a hyperbola, like _P 2_, along which the
body will move away never to return, while a velocity just at the limit
of what the sun can control gives an orbit like _P 3_, a parabola, along
which the body moves with _parabolic velocity_, which is ever
diminishing as the body gets farther from the sun, but is always just
sufficient to keep it from returning. If the earth's velocity could be
increased 41 per cent, from 19 up to 27 miles per second, it would have
parabolic velocity, and would quit the sun's company.

The summation of the whole matter is that the orbit in which a body
moves around the sun, or past the sun, depends upon its velocity and if
this velocity and the direction of the motion at any one point in the
orbit are known the whole orbit is determined by them, and the position
of the planet in its orbit for past as well as future times can be
determined through the application of Newton's laws; and the same is
true for any other heavenly body--moon, comet, meteor, etc. It is in
this way that astronomers are able to predict, years in advance, in what
particular part of the sky a given planet will appear at a given time.

It is sometimes a source of wonder that the planets move in ellipses
instead of circles, but it is easily seen from Fig. 20 that the planet,
_P_, could not by any possibility move in a circle, since the direction
of its motion at _P_ is not at right angles with the line joining it to
the sun as it must be in a circular orbit, and even if it were
perpendicular to the radius vector the planet must needs have exactly
the right velocity given to it at this point, since either more or less
speed would change the circle into an ellipse. In order to produce
circular motion there must be a balancing of conditions as nice as is
required to make a pin stand upon its point, and the really surprising
thing is that the orbits of the planets should be so nearly circular as
they are. If the orbit of the earth were drawn accurately to scale, the
untrained eye would not detect the slightest deviation from a true
circle, and even the orbit of Mercury (Fig. 17), which is much more
eccentric than that of the earth, might almost pass for a circle.

[Illustration: FIG. 21. An impossible orbit.]

The orbit _P 2_, which lies between the parabola and the straight line,
is called in geometry a hyperbola, and Newton succeeded in proving from
the law of gravitation that a body might move under the sun's attraction
in a hyperbola as well as in a parabola or ellipse; but it must move in
some one of these curves; no other orbit is possible.[1] Thus it would
not be possible for a body moving under the law of gravitation to
describe about the sun any such orbit as is shown in Fig. 21. If the
body passes a second time through any point of its orbit, such as _P_ in
the figure, then it must retrace, time after time, the whole path that
it first traversed in getting from _P_ around to _P_ again--i. e., the
orbit must be an ellipse.

  [1] The circle and straight line are considered to be special cases
      of these curves, which, taken collectively, are called the conic
      sections.

Newton also proved that Kepler's three laws are mere corollaries from
the law of gravitation, and that to be strictly correct the third law
must be slightly altered so as to take into account the masses of the
planets. These are, however, so small in comparison with that of the
sun, that the correction is of comparatively little moment.

39. PERTURBATIONS.--In what precedes we have considered the motion of a
planet under the influence of no other force than the sun's attraction,
while in fact, as the law of gravitation asserts, every other body in
the universe is in some measure attracting it and changing its motion.
The resulting disturbances in the motion of the attracted body are
called _perturbations_, but for the most part these are insignificant,
because the bodies by whose disturbing attractions they are caused are
either very small or very remote, and it is only when our moving planet,
_P_, comes under the influence of some great disturbing power like
Jupiter or one of the other planets that the perturbations caused by
their influence need to be taken into account.

The problem of the motion of three bodies--sun, Jupiter, planet--which
must then be dealt with is vastly more complicated than that which we
have considered, and the ablest mathematicians and astronomers have not
been able to furnish a complete solution for it, although they have
worked upon the problem for two centuries, and have developed an immense
amount of detailed information concerning it.

[Illustration: THE LICK OBSERVATORY, MOUNT HAMILTON, CAL.]

In general each planet works ceaselessly upon the orbit of every other,
changing its size and shape and position, backward and forward in
accordance with the law of gravitation, and it is a question of serious
moment how far this process may extend. If the diameter of the earth's
orbit were very much increased or diminished by the perturbing action of
the other planets, the amount of heat received from the sun would be
correspondingly changed, and the earth, perhaps, be rendered unfit
for the support of life. The tipping of the plane of the earth's orbit
into a new position might also produce serious consequences; but the
great French mathematician of a century ago, Laplace, succeeded in
proving from the law of gravitation that although both of these changes
are actually in progress they can not, at least for millions of years,
go far enough to prove of serious consequence, and the same is true for
all the other planets, unless here and there an asteroid may prove an
exception to the rule.

The precession (Chapter V) is a striking illustration of a perturbation
of slightly different character from the above, and another is found in
connection with the plane of the moon's orbit. It will be remembered
that the moon in its motion among the stars never goes far from the
ecliptic, but in a complete circuit of the heavens crosses it twice,
once in going from south to north and once in the opposite direction.
The points at which it crosses the ecliptic are called the _nodes_, and
under the perturbing influence of the sun these nodes move westward
along the ecliptic about twenty degrees per year, an extraordinarily
rapid perturbation, and one of great consequence in the theory of
eclipses.

[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A planet subject to great perturbations by
Jupiter.]

40. WEIGHING THE PLANETS.--Although these perturbations can not be
considered dangerous, they are interesting since they furnish a method
for weighing the planets which produce them. From the law of gravitation
we learn that the ability of a planet to produce perturbations depends
directly upon its mass, since the force _F_ which it exerts contains
this mass, _m´_, as a factor. So, too, the divisor _r^{2}_ in the
expression for the force shows that the distance between the disturbing
and disturbed bodies is a matter of great consequence, for the smaller
the distance the greater the force. When, therefore, the mass of a
planet such as Jupiter is to be determined from the perturbations it
produces, it is customary to select some such opportunity as is
presented in Fig. 22, where one of the small planets, called asteroids,
is represented as moving in a very eccentric orbit, which at one point
approaches close to the orbit of Jupiter, and at another place comes
near to the orbit of the earth. For the most part Jupiter will not exert
any very great disturbing influence upon a planet moving in such an
orbit as this, since it is only at rare intervals that the asteroid and
Jupiter approach so close to each other, as is shown in the figure. The
time during which the asteroid is little affected by the attraction of
Jupiter is used to study the motion given to it by the sun's
attraction--that is, to determine carefully the undisturbed orbit in
which it moves; but there comes a time at which the asteroid passes
close to Jupiter, as shown in the figure, and the orbital motion which
the sun imparts to it will then be greatly disturbed, and when the
planet next comes round to the part of its orbit near the earth the
effect of these disturbances upon its apparent position in the sky will
be exaggerated by its close proximity to the earth. If now the
astronomer observes the actual position of the asteroid in the sky, its
right ascension and declination, and compares these with the position
assigned to the planet by the law of gravitation when the attraction of
Jupiter is ignored, the differences between the observed right
ascensions and declinations and those computed upon the theory of
undisturbed motion will measure the influence that Jupiter has had upon
the asteroid, and the amount by which Jupiter has shifted it, compared
with the amount by which the sun has moved it--that is, with the motion
in its orbit--furnishes the mass of Jupiter expressed as a fractional
part of the mass of the sun.

There has been determined in this manner the mass of every planet in the
solar system which is large enough to produce any appreciable
perturbation, and all these masses prove to be exceedingly small
fractions of the mass of the sun, as may be seen from the following
table, in which is given opposite the name of each planet the number by
which the mass of the sun must be divided in order to get the mass of
the planet:

    Mercury      7,000,000 (?)
    Venus          408,000
    Earth          329,000
    Mars         3,093,500
    Jupiter          1,047.4
    Saturn           3,502
    Uranus          22,800
    Neptune         19,700

It is to be especially noted that the mass given for each planet
includes the mass of all the satellites which attend it, since their
influence was felt in the perturbations from which the mass was derived.
Thus the mass assigned to the earth is the combined mass of earth and
moon.

41. DISCOVERY OF NEPTUNE.--The most famous example of perturbations is
found in connection with the discovery, in the year 1846, of Neptune,
the outermost planet of the solar system. For many years the motion of
Uranus, his next neighbor, had proved a puzzle to astronomers. In
accordance with Kepler's first law this planet should move in an ellipse
having the sun at one of its foci, but no ellipse could be found which
exactly fitted its observed path among the stars, although, to be sure,
the misfit was not very pronounced. Astronomers surmised that the small
deviations of Uranus from the best path which theory combined with
observation could assign, were due to perturbations in its motion
caused by an unknown planet more remote from the sun--a thing easy to
conjecture but hard to prove, and harder still to find the unknown
disturber. But almost simultaneously two young men, Adams in England and
Le Verrier in France, attacked the problem quite independently of each
other, and carried it to a successful solution, showing that if the
irregularities in the motion of Uranus were indeed caused by an unknown
planet, then that planet must, in September, 1846, be in the direction
of the constellation Aquarius; and there it was found on September 23d
by the astronomers of the Berlin Observatory whom Le Verrier had invited
to search for it, and found within a degree of the exact point which the
law of gravitation in his hands had assigned to it.

This working backward from the perturbations experienced by Uranus to
the cause which produced them is justly regarded as one of the greatest
scientific achievements of the human intellect, and it is worthy of note
that we are approaching the time at which it may be repeated, for
Neptune now behaves much as did Uranus three quarters of a century ago,
and the most plausible explanation which can be offered for these
anomalies in its path is that the bounds of the solar system must be
again enlarged to include another disturbing planet.

42. THE SHAPE OF A PLANET.--There is an effect of gravitation not yet
touched upon, which is of considerable interest and wide application in
astronomy--viz., its influence in determining the shape of the heavenly
bodies. The earth is a globe because every part of it is drawn toward
the center by the attraction of the other parts, and if this attraction
on its surface were everywhere of equal force the material of the earth
would be crushed by it into a truly spherical form, no matter what may
have been the shape in which it was originally made. But such is not the
real condition of the earth, for its diurnal rotation develops in every
particle of its body a force which is sometimes called _centrifugal_,
but which is really nothing more than the inertia of its particles,
which tend at every moment to keep unchanged the direction of their
motion and which thus resist the attraction that pulls them into a
circular path marked out by the earth's rotation, just as a stone tied
at the end of a string and swung swiftly in a circle pulls upon the
string and opposes the constraint which keeps it moving in a circle. A
few experiments with such a stone will show that the faster it goes the
harder does it pull upon the string, and the same is true of each
particle of the earth, the swiftly moving ones near the equator having a
greater centrifugal force than the slow ones near the poles. At the
equator the centrifugal force is directly opposed to the force of
gravity, and in effect diminishes it, so that, comparatively, there is
an excess of gravity at the poles which compresses the earth along its
axis and causes it to bulge out at the equator until a balance is thus
restored. As we have learned from the study of geography, in the case of
the earth, this compression amounts to about 27 miles, but in the larger
planets, Jupiter and Saturn, it is much greater, amounting to several
thousand miles.

But rotation is not the only influence that tends to pull a planet out
of shape. The attraction which the earth exerts upon the moon is
stronger on the near side and weaker on the far side of our satellite
than at its center, and this difference of attraction tends to warp the
moon, as is illustrated in Fig. 23 where _1_, _2_, and _3_ represent
pieces of iron of equal mass placed in line on a table near a horseshoe
magnet, _H_. Each piece of iron is attracted by the magnet and is held
back by a weight to which it is fastened by means of a cord running over
a pulley, _P_, at the edge of the table. These weights are all to be
supposed equally heavy and each of them pulls upon its piece of iron
with a force just sufficient to balance the attraction of the magnet for
the middle piece, No. _2_. It is clear that under this arrangement No.
_2_ will move neither to the right nor to the left, since the forces
exerted upon it by the magnet and the weight just balance each other.
Upon No. _1_, however, the magnet pulls harder than upon No. _2_,
because it is nearer and its pull therefore more than balances the force
exerted by the weight, so that No. _1_ will be pulled away from No. _2_
and will stretch the elastic cords, which are represented by the lines
joining _1_ and _2_, until their tension, together with the force
exerted by the weight, just balances the attraction of the magnet. For
No. _3_, the force exerted by the magnet is less than that of the
weight, and it will also be pulled away from No. _2_ until its elastic
cords are stretched to the proper tension. The net result is that the
three blocks which, without the magnet's influence, would be held close
together by the elastic cords, are pulled apart by this outside force as
far as the resistance of the cords will permit.

[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Tide-raising forces.]

An entirely analogous set of forces produces a similar effect upon the
shape of the moon. The elastic cords of Fig. 23 stand for the attraction
of gravitation by which all the parts of the moon are bound together.
The magnet represents the earth pulling with unequal force upon
different parts of the moon. The weights are the inertia of the moon in
its orbital motion which, as we have seen in a previous section, upon
the whole just balances the earth's attraction and keeps the moon from
falling into it. The effect of these forces is to stretch out the
moon along a line pointing toward the earth, just as the blocks were
stretched out along the line of the magnet, and to make this diameter
of the moon slightly but permanently longer than the others.

[Illustration: FIG. 24.--The tides.]

THE TIDES.--Similarly the moon and the sun attract opposite sides of the
earth with different forces and feebly tend to pull it out of shape. But
here a new element comes into play: the earth turns so rapidly upon its
axis that its solid parts have no time in which to yield sensibly to the
strains, which shift rapidly from one diameter to another as different
parts of the earth are turned toward the moon, and it is chiefly the
waters of the sea which respond to the distorting effect of the sun's
and moon's attraction. These are heaped up on opposite sides of the
earth so as to produce a slight elongation of its diameter, and Fig. 24
shows how by the earth's rotation this swelling of the waters is swept
out from under the moon and is pulled back by the moon until it finally
takes up some such position as that shown in the figure where the effect
of the earth's rotation in carrying it one way is just balanced by the
moon's attraction urging it back on line with the moon. This heaping up
of the waters is called a _tide_. If _I_ in the figure represents a
little island in the sea the waters which surround it will of course
accompany it in its diurnal rotation about the earth's axis, but
whenever the island comes back to the position _I_, the waters will
swell up as a part of the tidal wave and will encroach upon the land in
what is called high tide or flood tide. So too when they reach _I´´_,
half a day later, they will again rise in flood tide, and midway between
these points, at _I´_, the waters must subside, giving low or ebb tide.

The height of the tide raised by the moon in the open sea is only a very
few feet, and the tide raised by the sun is even less, but along the
coast of a continent, in bays and angles of the shore, it often happens
that a broad but low tidal wave is forced into a narrow corner, and then
the rise of the water may be many feet, especially when the solar tide
and the lunar tide come in together, as they do twice in every month, at
new and full moon. Why do they come together at these times instead of
some other?

Small as are these tidal effects, it is worth noting that they may in
certain cases be very much greater--e. g., if the moon were as massive
as is the sun its tidal effect would be some millions of times greater
than it now is and would suffice to grind the earth into fragments.
Although the earth escapes this fate, some other bodies are not so
fortunate, and we shall see in later chapters some evidence of their
disintegration.

43. THE SCOPE OF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION.--In all the domain of physical
science there is no other law so famous as the Newtonian law of
gravitation; none other that has been so dwelt upon, studied, and
elaborated by astronomers and mathematicians, and perhaps none that can
be considered so indisputably proved. Over and over again mathematical
analysis, based upon this law, has pointed out conclusions which, though
hitherto unsuspected, have afterward been found true, as when Newton
himself derived as a corollary from this law that the earth ought to be
flattened at the poles--a thing not known at that time, and not proved
by actual measurement until long afterward. It is, in fact, this
capacity for predicting the unknown and for explaining in minutest
detail the complicated phenomena of the heavens and the earth that
constitutes the real proof of the law of gravitation, and it is
therefore worth while to note that at the present time there are a very
few points at which the law fails to furnish a satisfactory account of
things observed. Chief among these is the case of the planet Mercury,
the long diameter of whose orbit is slowly turning around in a way for
which the law of gravitation as yet furnishes no explanation. Whether
this is because the law itself is inaccurate or incomplete, or whether
it only marks a case in which astronomers have not yet properly applied
the law and traced out its consequences, we do not know; but whether it
be the one or the other, this and other similar cases show that even
here, in its most perfect chapter, astronomy still remains an incomplete
science.




CHAPTER V

THE EARTH AS A PLANET


44. THE SIZE OF THE EARTH.--The student is presumed to have learned, in
his study of geography, that the earth is a globe about 8,000 miles in
diameter and, without dwelling upon the "proofs" which are commonly
given for these statements, we proceed to consider the principles upon
which the measurement of the earth's size and shape are based.

[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Measuring the size of the earth.]

In Fig. 25 the circle represents a meridian section of the earth; _P P´_
is the axis about which it rotates, and the dotted lines represent a
beam of light coming from a star in the plane of the meridian, and so
distant that the dotted lines are all practically parallel to each
other. The several radii drawn through the points _1_, _2_, _3_,
represent the direction of the vertical at these points, and the angles
which these radii produced, make with the rays of starlight are each
equal to the angular distance of the star from the zenith of the place
at the moment the star crosses the meridian. We have already seen, in
Chapter II, how these angles may be measured, and it is apparent from
the figure that the difference between any two of these angles--e. g.,
the angles at _1_ and _2_--is equal to the angle at the center, _O_,
between the points _1_ and _2_. By measuring these angular distances of
the star from the zenith, the astronomer finds the angles at the center
of the earth between the stations _1_, _2_, _3_, etc., at which his
observations are made. If the meridian were a perfect circle the change
of zenith distance of the star, as one traveled along a meridian from
the equator to the pole, would be perfectly uniform--the same number of
degrees for each hundred miles traveled--and observations made in many
parts of the earth show that this is very nearly true, but that, on the
whole, as we approach the pole it is necessary to travel a little
greater distance than is required for a given change in the angle at the
equator. The earth is, in fact, flattened at the poles to the amount of
about 27 miles in the length of its diameter, and by this amount, as
well as by smaller variations due to mountains and valleys, the shape of
the earth differs from a perfect sphere. These astronomical measurements
of the curvature of the earth's surface furnish by far the most
satisfactory proof that it is very approximately a sphere, and furnish
as its equatorial diameter 7,926 miles.

Neglecting the _compression_, as it is called, i. e., the 27 miles by
which the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar, the size of the earth
may easily be found by measuring the distance _1_--_2_ along the
surface and by combining with this the angle _1 O 2_ obtained through
measuring the meridian altitudes of any star as seen from _1_ and _2_.
Draw on paper an angle equal to the measured difference of altitude and
find how far you must go from its vertex in order to have the distance
between the sides, measured along an arc of a circle, equal to the
measured distance between _1_ and _2_. This distance from the vertex
will be the earth's radius.

EXERCISE 19.--Measure the diameter of the earth by the method given
above. In order that this may be done satisfactorily, the two stations
at which observations are made must be separated by a considerable
distance--i. e., 200 miles. They need not be on the same meridian, but
if they are on different meridians in place of the actual distance
between them, there must be used the projection of that distance upon
the meridian--i. e., the north and south part of the distance.

By co-operation between schools in the Northern and Southern States,
using a good map to obtain the required distances, the diameter of the
earth may be measured with the plumb-line apparatus described in Chapter
II and determined within a small percentage of its true value.

45. THE MASS OF THE EARTH.--We have seen in Chapter IV the possibility
of determining the masses of the planets as fractional parts of the
sun's mass, but nothing was there shown, or could be shown, about
measuring these masses after the common fashion in kilogrammes or tons.
To do this we must first get the mass of the earth in tons or
kilogrammes, and while the principles involved in this determination are
simple enough, their actual application is delicate and difficult.

[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Illustrating the principles involved in
weighing the earth.]

In Fig. 26 we suppose a long plumb line to be suspended above the
surface of the earth and to be attracted toward the center of the earth,
_C_, by a force whose intensity is (Chapter IV)

    F = k mE/R^{2},

where _E_ denotes the mass of the earth, which is to be determined by
experiment, and _R_ is the radius of the earth, 3,963 miles. If there is
no disturbing influence present, the plumb line will point directly
downward, but if a massive ball of lead or other heavy substance is
placed at one side, _1_, it will attract the plumb line with a force
equal to

    f = k mB/r^{2},

where _r_ is the distance of its center from the plumb bob and _B_ is
its mass which we may suppose, for illustration, to be a ton. In
consequence of this attraction the plumb line will be pulled a little to
one side, as shown by the dotted line, and if we represent by _l_ the
length of the plumb line and by _d_ the distance between the original
and the disturbed positions of the plumb bob we may write the proportion

    F : f :: l : d;

and introducing the values of _F_ and _f_ given above, and solving for
_E_ the proportion thus transformed, we find

    E = B × l/d × (R/r)^{2}.

In this equation the mass of the ball, _B_, the length of the plumb
line, _l_, the distance between the center of the ball and the center of
the plumb bob, _r_, and the radius of the earth, _R_, can all be
measured directly, and _d_, the amount by which the plumb bob is pulled
to one side by the ball, is readily found by shifting the ball over to
the other side, at _2_, and measuring with a microscope how far the
plumb bob moves. This distance will, of course, be equal to _2 d_.

By methods involving these principles, but applied in a manner more
complicated as well as more precise, the mass of the earth is found to
be, in tons, 6,642 × 10^{18}--i. e., 6,642 followed by 18 ciphers, or in
kilogrammes 60,258 × 10^{20}. The earth's atmosphere makes up about a
millionth part of this mass.

If the length of the plumb line were 100 feet, the weight of the ball a
ton, and the distance between the two positions of the ball, _1_ and
_2_, six feet, how many inches, _d_, would the plumb bob be pulled out
of place?

Find from the mass of the earth and the data of § 40 the mass of the sun
in tons. Find also the mass of Mars. The computation can be very greatly
abridged by the use of logarithms.

46. PRECESSION.--That the earth is isolated in space and has no support
upon which to rest, is sufficiently shown by the fact that the stars are
visible upon every side of it, and no support can be seen stretching out
toward them. We must then consider the earth to be a globe traveling
freely about the sun in a circuit which it completes once every year,
and rotating once in every twenty-four hours about an axis which remains
at all seasons directed very nearly toward the star Polaris. The student
should be able to show from his own observations of the sun that, with
reference to the stars, the direction of the sun from the earth changes
about a degree a day. Does this prove that the earth revolves about the
sun?

But it is only in appearance that the pole maintains its fixed position
among the stars. If photographs are taken year after year, after the
manner of Exercise 7, it will be found that slowly the pole is moving
(nearly) toward Polaris, and making this star describe a smaller and
smaller circle in its diurnal path, while stars on the other side of the
pole (in right ascension 12h.) become more distant from it and describe
larger circles in their diurnal motion; but the process takes place so
slowly that the space of a lifetime is required for the motion of the
pole to equal the angular diameter of the full moon.

Spin a top and note how its rapid whirl about its axis corresponds to
the earth's diurnal rotation. When the axis about which the top spins is
truly vertical the top "sleeps"; but if the axis is tipped ever so
little away from the vertical it begins to wobble, so that if we imagine
the axis prolonged out to the sky and provided with a pencil point as a
marker, this would trace a circle around the zenith, along which the
pole of the top would move, and a little observation will show that the
more the top is tipped from the vertical the larger does this circle
become and the more rapidly does the wobbling take place. Were it not
for the spinning of the top about its axis, it would promptly fall over
when tipped from the vertical position, but the spin combines with the
force which pulls the top over and produces the wobbling motion. Spin
the top in opposite directions, with the hands of a watch and contrary
to the hands of a watch, and note the effect which is produced upon the
wobbling.

The earth presents many points of resemblance to the top. Its diurnal
rotation is the spin about the axis. This axis is tipped 23.5° away from
the perpendicular to its orbit (obliquity of the ecliptic) just as the
axis of the top is tipped away from the vertical line. In consequence of
its rapid spin, the body of the earth bulges out at the equator (27
miles), and the sun and moon, by virtue of their attraction (see Chapter
IV), lay hold of this protuberance and pull it down toward the plane of
the earth's orbit, so that if it were not for the spin this force would
straighten the axis up and set it perpendicular to the orbit plane. But
here, as in the case of the top, the spin and the tipping force combine
to produce a wobble which is called precession, and whose effect we
recognize in the shifting position of the pole among the stars. The
motion of precession is very much slower than the wobbling of the top,
since the tipping force for the earth is relatively very small, and a
period of nearly 26,000 years is required for a complete circuit of the
pole about its center of motion. Friction ultimately stops both the spin
and the wobble of the top, but this influence seems wholly absent in the
case of the earth, and both rotation and precession go on unchanged from
century to century, save for certain minor forces which for a time
change the direction or rate of the precessional motion, first in one
way and then in another, without in the long run producing any results
of consequence.

The center of motion, about which the pole travels in a small circle
having an angular radius of 23.5°, is at that point of the heavens
toward which a perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit points,
and may be found on the star map in right ascension 18h. 0m. and
declination 66.5°.

EXERCISE 20.--Find this point on the map, and draw as well as you can
the path of the pole about it. The motion of the pole along its path is
toward the constellation Cepheus. Mark the position of the pole along
this path at intervals of 1,000 years, and refer to these positions in
dealing with some of the following questions:

Does the wobbling of the top occur in the same direction as the motion
of precession? Do the tipping forces applied to the earth and top act in
the same direction? What will be the polar star 12,000 years hence? The
Great Pyramid of Egypt is thought to have been used as an observatory
when Alpha Draconis was the bright star nearest the pole. How long ago
was that?

The motion of the pole of course carries the equator and the equinoxes
with it, and thus slowly changes the right ascensions and declinations
of all the stars. On this account it is frequently called the precession
of the equinoxes, and this motion of the equinox, slow though it is, is
a matter of some consequence in connection with chronology and the
length of the year.

Will the precession ever bring back the right ascensions and
declinations to be again what they now are?

In what direction is the pole moving with respect to the Big Dipper?
Will its motion ever bring it exactly to Polaris? How far away from
Polaris will the precession carry the pole? What other bright stars will
be brought near the pole by the precession?

47. THE WARMING OF THE EARTH.--Winter and summer alike the day is on the
average warmer than the night, and it is easy to see that this surplus
of heat comes from the sun by day and is lost by night through radiation
into the void which surrounds the earth; just as the heat contained in a
mass of molten iron is radiated away and the iron cooled when it is
taken out from the furnace and placed amid colder surroundings. The
earth's loss of heat by radiation goes on ceaselessly day and night,
and were it not for the influx of solar heat this radiation would
steadily diminish the temperature toward what is called the "absolute
zero"--i. e., a state in which all heat has been taken away and beyond
which there can be no greater degree of cold. This must not be
confounded with the zero temperatures shown by our thermometers,
since it lies nearly 500° below the zero of the Fahrenheit scale (-273°
Centigrade), a temperature which by comparison makes the coldest winter
weather seem warm, although the ordinary thermometer may register
many degrees below its zero. The heat radiated by the sun into the
surrounding space on every side of it is another example of the same
cooling process, a hot body giving up its heat to the colder space about
it, and it is the minute fraction of this heat poured out by the sun,
and in small part intercepted by the earth, which warms the latter and
produces what we call weather, climate, the seasons, etc.

Observe the fluctuations, the ebb and flow, which are inherent in this
process. From sunset to sunrise there is nothing to compensate the
steady outflow of heat, and air and ground grow steadily colder, but
with the sunrise there comes an influx of solar heat, feeble at first
because it strikes the earth's surface very obliquely, but becoming more
and more efficient as the sun rises higher in the sky. But as the air
and the ground grow warm during the morning hours they part more and
more readily and rapidly with their store of heat, just as a steam pipe
or a cup of coffee radiates heat more rapidly when very hot. The warmest
hour of the day is reached when these opposing tendencies of income and
expenditure of heat are just balanced; and barring such disturbing
factors as wind and clouds, the gain in temperature usually extends to
the time--an hour or two beyond noon--at which the diminishing altitude
of the sun renders his rays less efficient, when radiation gains the
upper hand and the temperature becomes for a short time stationary, and
then commences to fall steadily until the next sunrise.

We have here an example of what is called a periodic change--i. e., one
which, within a definite and uniform period (24 hours), oscillates from
a minimum up to a maximum temperature and then back again to a minimum,
repeating substantially the same variation day after day. But it must be
understood that minor causes not taken into account above, such as
winds, water, etc., produce other fluctuations from day to day which
sometimes obscure or even obliterate the diurnal variation of
temperature caused by the sun.

Expose the back of your hand to the sun, holding the hand in such a
position that the sunlight strikes perpendicularly upon it; then turn
the hand so that the light falls quite obliquely upon it and note how
much more vigorous is the warming effect of the sun in the first
position than in the second. It is chiefly this difference of angle that
makes the sun's warmth more effective when he is high up in the sky than
when he is near the horizon, and more effective in summer than in
winter.

We have seen in Chapter III that the sun's motion among the stars takes
place along a path which carries it alternately north and south of the
equator to a distance of 23.5°, and the stars show by their earlier
risings and later settings, as we pass from the equator toward the north
pole of the heavens, that as the sun moves northward from the equator,
each day in the northern hemisphere will become a little longer, each
night a little shorter, and every day the sun will rise higher toward
the zenith until this process culminates toward the end of June, when
the sun begins to move southward, bringing shorter days and smaller
altitudes until the Christmas season, when again it is reversed and the
sun moves northward. We have here another periodic variation, which runs
its complete course in a period of a year, and it is easy to see that
this variation must have a marked effect on the warming of the earth,
the long days and great altitudes of summer producing the greater warmth
of that season, while the shorter days and lower altitudes of December,
by diminishing the daily supply of solar heat, bring on the winter's
cold. The succession of the seasons, winter following summer and summer
winter, is caused by the varying altitude of the sun, and this in turn
is due to the obliquity of the ecliptic, or, what is the same thing, the
amount by which the axis of the earth is tipped from being perpendicular
to the plane of its orbit, and the seasons are simply a periodic change
in the warming of the earth, quite comparable with the diurnal change
but of longer period.

It is evident that the period within which the succession of winter and
summer is completed, the year, as we commonly call it, must equal the
time required by the sun to go from the vernal equinox around to the
vernal equinox again, since this furnishes a complete cycle of the sun's
motions north and south from the equator. On account of the westward
motion of the equinox (precession) this is not quite the same as the
time required for a complete revolution of the earth in its orbit, but
is a little shorter (20m. 23s.), since the equinox moves back to meet
the sun.

48. RELATION OF THE SUN TO CLIMATE.--It is clear that both the northern
and southern hemispheres of the earth must have substantially the same
kind of seasons, since the motion of the sun north and south affects
both alike; but when the sun is north of the equator and warming our
hemisphere most effectively, his light falls more obliquely upon the
other hemisphere, the days there are short and winter reigns at the
time we are enjoying summer, while six months later the conditions are
reversed.

In those parts of the earth near the equator--the torrid zone--there is
no such marked change from cold to warm as we experience, because, as
the sun never gets more than 23.5° away from the celestial equator, on
every day of the year he mounts high in the tropic skies, always coming
within 23.5° of the zenith, and usually closer than this, so that there
is no such periodic change in the heat supply as is experienced in
higher latitudes, and within the tropics the temperature is therefore
both higher and more uniform than in our latitude.

In the frigid zones, on the contrary, the sun never rises high in the
sky; at the poles his greatest altitude is only 23.5°, and during the
winter season he does not rise at all, so that the temperature is here
low the whole year round, and during the winter season, when for weeks
or months at a time the supply of solar light is entirely cut off, the
temperature falls to a degree unknown in more favored climes.

If the obliquity of the ecliptic were made 10° greater, what would be
the effect upon the seasons in the temperate zones? What if it were made
10° less?

Does the precession of the equinoxes have any effect upon the seasons or
upon the climate of different parts of the earth?

If the axis of the earth pointed toward Arcturus instead of Polaris,
would the seasons be any different from what they are now?

49. THE ATMOSPHERE.--Although we live upon its surface, we are not
outside the earth, but at the bottom of a sea of air which forms the
earth's outermost layer and extends above our heads to a height of many
miles. The study of most of the phenomena of the atmosphere belongs to
that branch of physics called meteorology, but there are a few matters
which fairly come within our consideration of the earth as a planet. We
can not see the stars save as we look through this atmosphere, and the
light which comes through it is bent and oftentimes distorted so as to
present serious obstacles to any accurate telescopic study of the
heavenly bodies. Frequently this disturbance is visible to the naked
eye, and the stars are said to twinkle--i. e., to quiver and change
color many times per second, solely in consequence of a disturbed
condition of the air and not from anything which goes on in the star.
This effect is more marked low down in the sky than near the zenith, and
it is worth noting that the planets show very little of it because the
light they send to the earth comes from a disk of sensible area, while a
star, being much smaller and farther from the earth, has its disk
reduced practically to a mere point whose light is more easily affected
by local disturbances in the atmosphere than is the broader beam which
comes from the planets' disk.

50. REFRACTION.--At all times, whether the stars twinkle or not, their
light is bent in its passage through the atmosphere, so that the stars
appear to stand higher up in the sky than their true positions. This
effect, which the astronomer calls refraction, must be allowed for in
observations of the more precise class, although save at low altitudes
its amount is a very small fraction of a degree, but near the horizon it
is much exaggerated in amount and becomes easily visible to the naked
eye by distorting the disks of the sun and moon from circles into ovals
with their long diameters horizontal. The refraction lifts both upper
and lower edge of the sun, but lifts the lower edge more than the upper,
thus shortening the vertical diameter. See Fig. 27, which shows not only
this effect, but also the reflection of the sun from the curved surface
of the sea, still further flattening the image. If the surface of the
water were flat, the reflected image would have the same shape as the
sun's disk, and its altered appearance is sometimes cited as a proof
that the earth's surface is curved.

The total amount of the refraction at the horizon is a little more than
half a degree, and since the diameters of the sun and moon subtend an
angle of about half a degree, we have the remarkable result that in
reality the whole disk of either sun or moon is below the horizon at the
instant that the lower edge appears to touch the horizon and sunset or
moonset begins. The same effect exists at sunrise, and as a consequence
the duration of sunshine or of moonshine is on the average about six
minutes longer each day than it would be if there were no atmosphere and
no refraction. A partial offset to this benefit is found in the fact
that the atmosphere absorbs the light of the heavenly bodies, so that
stars appear much less bright when near the horizon than when they are
higher up in the sky, and by reason of this absorption the setting sun
can be looked at with the naked eye without the discomfort which its
dazzling luster causes at noon.

[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Flattening of the sun's disk by refraction and
by reflection from the surface of the sea.]

51. THE TWILIGHT.--Another effect of the atmosphere, even more marked
than the preceding, is the twilight. As at sunrise the mountain top
catches the rays of the coming sun before they reach the lowland, and at
sunset it keeps them after they have faded from the regions below, so
the particles of dust and vapor, which always float in the atmosphere,
catch the sunlight and reflect it to the surface of the earth while the
sun is still below the horizon, giving at the beginning and end of day
that vague and diffuse light which we call twilight.

[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Twilight phenomena.]

Fig. 28 shows a part of the earth surrounded by such a dust-laden
atmosphere, which is illuminated on the left by the rays of the sun, but
which, on the right of the figure, lies in the shadow cast by the earth.
To an observer placed at _1_ the sun is just setting, and all the
atmosphere above him is illumined with its rays, which furnish a bright
twilight. When, by the earth's rotation, this observer has been carried
to _2_, all the region to the east of his zenith lies in the shadow,
while to the west there is a part of the atmosphere from which there
still comes a twilight, but now comparatively faint, because the lower
part of the atmosphere about our observer lies in the shadow, and it is
mainly its upper regions from which the light comes, and here the dust
and moisture are much less abundant than in the lower strata. Still
later, when the observer has been carried by the earth's rotation to the
point _3_, every vestige of twilight will have vanished from his sky,
because all of the illuminated part of the atmosphere is now below his
horizon, which is represented by the line _3 L_. In the figure the sun
is represented to be 78° below this horizon line at the end of twilight,
but this is a gross exaggeration, made for the sake of clearness in the
drawing--in fact, twilight is usually said to end when the sun is 18°
below the horizon.

Let the student redraw Fig. 28 on a large scale, so that the points _1_
and _3_ shall be only 18° apart, as seen from the earth's center. He
will find that the point _L_ is brought down much closer to the surface
of the earth, and measuring the length of the line _2 L_, he should find
for the "height of the atmosphere" about one-eightieth part of the
radius of the earth--i. e., a little less than 50 miles. This, however,
is not the true height of the atmosphere. The air extends far beyond
this, but the particles of dust and vapor which are capable of sending
sunlight down to the earth seem all to lie below this limit.

The student should not fail to watch the eastern sky after sunset, and
see the shadow of the earth rise up and fill it while the twilight arch
retreats steadily toward the west.

[Illustration: FIG. 29.--The cause of long and short twilights.]

_Duration of twilight._--Since twilight ends when the sun is 18° below
the horizon, any circumstance which makes the sun go down rapidly will
shorten the duration of twilight, and anything which retards the
downward motion of the sun will correspondingly prolong it. Chief among
influences of this kind is the angle which the sun's course makes with
the horizon. If it goes straight down, as at _a_, Fig. 29, a much
shorter time will suffice to carry it to a depression of 18° than is
needed in the case shown at _b_ in the same figure, where the motion is
very oblique to the horizon. If we consider different latitudes and
different seasons of the year, we shall find every possible variety of
circumstance from _a_ to _b_, and corresponding to these, the duration
of twilight varies from an all-night duration in the summers of Scotland
and more northern lands to an hour or less in the mountains of Peru. For
the sake of graphical effect, the shortness of tropical twilight is
somewhat exaggerated by Coleridge in the lines,

    "The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
     At one stride comes the dark."
                            _The Ancient Mariner._

In the United States the longest twilights come at the end of June, and
last for a little more than two hours, while the shortest ones are in
March and September, amounting to a little more than an hour and a half;
but at all times the last half hour of twilight is hardly to be
distinguished from night, so small is the quantity of reflecting matter
in the upper regions of the atmosphere. For practical convenience it is
customary to assume in the courts of law that twilight ends an hour
after sunset.

How long does twilight last at the north pole?

_The Aurora._--One other phenomenon of the atmosphere may be mentioned,
only to point out that it is not of an astronomical character. The
Aurora, or northern lights, is as purely an affair of the earth as is a
thunderstorm, and its explanation belongs to the subject of terrestrial
magnetism.




CHAPTER VI

THE MEASUREMENT OF TIME


52. SOLAR TIME.--To measure any quantity we need a unit in terms of
which it must be expressed. Angles are measured in degrees, and the
degree is the unit for angular measurement. For most scientific purposes
the centimeter is adopted as the unit with which to measure distances,
and similarly a day is the fundamental unit for the measurement of time.
Hours, minutes, and seconds are aliquot parts of this unit convenient
for use in dealing with shorter periods than a day, and the week, month,
and year which we use in our calendars are multiples of the day.

Strictly speaking, a day is not the time required by the earth to make
one revolution upon its axis, but it is best defined as the amount of
time required for a particular part of the sky to make the complete
circuit from the meridian of a particular place through west and east
back to the meridian again. The day begins at the moment when this
specified part of the sky is on the meridian, and "the time" at any
moment is the hour angle of this particular part of the sky--i. e., the
number of hours, minutes, etc., that have elapsed since it was on the
meridian.

The student has already become familiar with the kind of day which is
based upon the motion of the vernal equinox, and which furnishes
sidereal time, and he has seen that sidereal time, while very convenient
in dealing with the motions of the stars, is decidedly inconvenient for
the ordinary affairs of life since in the reckoning of the hours it
takes no account of daylight and darkness. One can not tell off-hand
whether 10 hours, sidereal time, falls in the day or in the night. We
must in some way obtain a day and a system of time reckoning based upon
the apparent diurnal motion of the sun, and we may, if we choose, take
the sun itself as the point in the heavens whose transit over the
meridian shall mark the beginning and the end of the day. In this system
"the time" is the number of hours, minutes, etc., which have elapsed
since the sun was on the meridian, and this is the kind of time which is
shown by a sun dial, and which was in general use, years ago, before
clocks and watches became common. Since the sun moves among the stars
about a degree per day, it is easily seen that the rotating earth will
have to turn farther in order to carry any particular meridian from the
sun around to the sun again, than to carry it from a star around to the
same star, or from the vernal equinox around to the vernal equinox
again; just as the minute hand of a clock turns farther in going from
the hour hand round to the hour hand again than it turns in going from
XII to XII. These solar days and hours and minutes are therefore a
little longer than the corresponding sidereal ones, and this furnishes
the explanation why the stars come to the meridian a little earlier, by
solar time, every night than on the night before, and why sidereal time
gains steadily upon solar time, this gain amounting to approximately
3m. 56.5s. per day, or exactly one day per year, since the sun makes the
complete circuit of the constellations once in a year.

With the general introduction of clocks and watches into use about a
century ago this kind of solar time went out of common use, since no
well-regulated clock could keep the time correctly. The earth in its
orbital motion around the sun goes faster in some parts of its orbit
than in others, and in consequence the sun appears to move more rapidly
among the stars in winter than in summer; moreover, on account of the
convergence of hour circles as we go away from the equator, the same
amount of motion along the ecliptic produces more effect in winter and
summer when the sun is north or south, than it does in the spring and
autumn when the sun is near the equator, and as a combined result of
these causes and other minor ones true solar time, as it is called, is
itself not uniform, but falls behind the uniform lapse of sidereal time
at a variable rate, sometimes quicker, sometimes slower. A true solar
day, from noon to noon, is 51 seconds shorter in September than in
December.

[Illustration: FIG. 30.--The equation of time.]

53. MEAN SOLAR TIME.--To remedy these inconveniences there has been
invented and brought into common use what is called _mean solar time_,
which is perfectly uniform in its lapse and which, by comparison with
sidereal time, loses exactly one day per year. "The time" in this system
never differs much from true solar time, and the difference between the
two for any particular day may be found in any good almanac, or may be
read from the curve in Fig. 30, in which the part of the curve above the
line marked _0m_ shows how many minutes mean solar time is faster than
true solar time. The correct name for this difference between the two
kinds of solar time is the _equation of time_, but in the almanacs it is
frequently marked "sun fast" or "sun slow." In sidereal time and true
solar time the distinction between A. M. hours (_ante meridiem_ =
before the sun reaches the meridian) and P. M. hours (_post meridiem_ =
after the sun has passed the meridian) is not observed, "the time" being
counted from 0 hours to 24 hours, commencing when the sun or vernal
equinox is on the meridian. Occasionally the attempt is made to
introduce into common use this mode of reckoning the hours, beginning
the day (date) at midnight and counting the hours consecutively up to
24, when the next date is reached and a new start made. Such a system
would simplify railway time tables and similar publications; but the
American public is slow to adopt it, although the system has come into
practical use in Canada and Spain.

54. TO FIND (APPROXIMATELY) THE SIDEREAL TIME AT ANY MOMENT.--RULE I.
When the mean solar time is known. Let _W_ represent the time shown by
an ordinary watch, and represent by _S_ the corresponding sidereal time
and by _D_ the number of days that have elapsed from March 23d to the
date in question. Then

    S = W + 69/70 × D × 4.

The last term is expressed in minutes, and should be reduced to hours
and minutes. Thus at 4 P. M. on July 4th--

                _D_ = 103 days.
    69/70 × _D_ × 4 = 406m.
                    = 6h. 46m.
                _W_ = 4h. 0m.
                _S_ = 10h. 46m.

The daily gain of sidereal upon mean solar time is 69/70 of 4 minutes,
and March 23d is the date on which sidereal and mean solar time are
together, taking the average of one year with another, but it varies a
little from year to year on account of the extra day introduced in leap
years.

RULE II. When the stars in the northern sky can be seen. Find β
Cassiopeiæ, and imagine a line drawn from it to Polaris, and another
line from Polaris to the zenith. The sidereal time is equal to the angle
between these lines, provided that that angle must be measured from the
zenith toward the west. Turn the angle from degrees into hours by
dividing by 15.

55. THE EARTH'S ROTATION.--We are familiar with the fact that a watch
may run faster at one time than at another, and it is worth while to
inquire if the same is not true of our chief timepiece--the earth. It is
assumed in the sections upon the measurement of time that the earth
turns about its axis with absolute uniformity, so that mean solar time
never gains or loses even the smallest fraction of a second. Whether
this be absolutely true or not, no one has ever succeeded in finding
convincing proof of a variation large enough to be measured, although it
has recently been shown that the axis about which it rotates is not
perfectly fixed within the body of the earth. The solid body of the
earth wriggles about this axis like a fish upon a hook, so that the
position of the north pole upon the earth's surface changes within a
year to the extent of 40 or 50 feet (15 meters) without ever getting
more than this distance away from its average position. This is probably
caused by the periodical shifting of masses of air and water from one
part of the earth to another as the seasons change, and it seems
probable that these changes will produce some small effect upon the
rotation of the earth. But in spite of these, for any such moderate
interval of time as a year or a century, so far as present knowledge
goes, we may regard the earth's rotation as uniform and undisturbed. For
longer intervals--e. g., 1,000,000 or 10,000,000 years--the question is
a very different one, and we shall have to meet it again in another
connection.

56. LONGITUDE AND TIME.--In what precedes there has been constant
reference to the meridian. The day begins when the sun is on the
meridian. Solar time is the angular distance of the sun past the
meridian. Sidereal time was determined by observing transits of stars
over a meridian line actually laid out upon the ground, etc. But every
place upon the earth has its own meridian from which "the time" may be
reckoned, and in Fig. 31, where the rays of sunlight are represented as
falling upon a part of the earth's equator through which the meridians
of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco pass, it is evident that these
rays make different angles with the meridians, and that the sun is
farther from the meridian of New York than from that of San Francisco by
an amount just equal to the angle at _O_ between these meridians. This
angle is called by geographers the difference of longitude between the
two places, and the student should note that the word longitude is here
used in a different sense from that on page 36. From Fig. 31 we obtain
the

_Theorem._--The difference between "the times" at any two meridians is
equal to their difference of longitude, and the time at the eastern
meridian is greater than at the western meridian. Astronomers usually
express differences of longitude in hours instead of degrees. 1h. = 15°.

The name given to any kind of time should distinguish all the elements
which enter into it--e. g., New York sidereal time means the hour angle
of the vernal equinox measured from the meridian of New York, Chicago
true solar time is the hour angle of the sun reckoned from the meridian
of Chicago, etc.

[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Longitude and time]

[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Standard time.]

57. STANDARD TIME.--The requirements of railroad traffic have led to the
use throughout the United States and Canada of four "standard times,"
each of which is a mean solar time some integral number of hours slower
than the time of the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich, England.

    Eastern time is 5 hours slower than that of Greenwich.
    Central  "      6  "      "     "    "         "
    Mountain "      7  "      "     "    "         "
    Pacific  "      8  "      "     "    "         "

In Fig. 32 the broken lines indicate roughly the parts of the United
States and Canada in which these several kinds of time are used, and
illustrate how irregular are the boundaries of these parts.

Standard time is sent daily into all of the more important telegraph
offices of the United States, and serves to regulate watches and clocks,
to the almost complete exclusion of local time.

58. TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDE.--With an ordinary watch observe the time
of the sun's transit over your local meridian, and correct the observed
time for the equation of time by means of the curve in Fig. 30. The
difference between the corrected time and 12 o'clock will be the
correction of your watch referred to local mean solar time. Compare your
watch with the time signals in the nearest telegraph office and find its
correction referred to standard time. The difference between the two
corrections is the difference between your longitude and that of the
standard meridian.

N. B.--Don't tamper with the watch by trying to "set it right." No harm
will be done if it is wrong, provided you take due account of the
correction as indicated above.

If the correction of the watch changed between your observation and the
comparison in the telegraph office, what effect would it have upon the
longitude determination? How can you avoid this effect?

59. CHRONOLOGY.--The Century Dictionary defines chronology as "the
science of time"--that is, "the method of measuring or computing time
by regular divisions or periods according to the revolutions of the sun
or moon."

We have already seen that for the measurement of short intervals of time
the day and its subdivisions--hours, minutes, seconds--furnish a very
complete and convenient system. But for longer periods, extending to
hundreds and thousands of days, a larger unit of time is required, and
for the most part these longer units have in all ages and among all
peoples been based upon astronomical considerations. But to this there
is one marked exception. The week is a simple multiple of the day, as
the dime is a multiple of the cent, and while it may have had its origin
in the changing phases of the moon this is at best doubtful, since it
does not follow these with any considerable accuracy. If the still
longer units of time--the month and the year--had equally been made to
consist of an integral number of days much confusion and
misunderstanding might have been avoided, and the annals of ancient
times would have presented fewer pitfalls to the historian than is now
the case. The month is plainly connected with the motion of the moon
among the stars. The year is, of course, based upon the motion of the
sun through the heavens and the change of seasons which is thus
produced; although, as commonly employed, it is not quite the same as
the time required by the earth to make one complete revolution in its
orbit. This time of one revolution is called a sidereal year, while, as
we have already seen in Chapter V, the year which measures the course of
the seasons is shorter than this on account of the precession of the
equinoxes. It is called a tropical year with reference to the circuit
which the sun makes from one tropic to the other and back again.

We can readily understand why primitive peoples should adopt as units of
time these natural periods, but in so doing they incurred much the same
kind of difficulty that we should experience in trying to use both
English and American money in the ordinary transactions of life. How
many dollars make a pound sterling? How shall we make change with
English shillings and American dimes, etc.? How much is one unit worth
in terms of the other?

One of the Greek poets[2] has left us a quaint account of the confusion
which existed in his time with regard to the place of months and moons
in the calendar:

    "The moon by us to you her greeting sends,
    But bids us say that she's an ill-used moon
    And takes it much amiss that you will still
    Shuffle her days and turn them topsy-turvy,
    So that when gods, who know their feast days well,
    By your false count are sent home supperless,
    They scold and storm at her for your neglect."

  [2] Aristophanes, The Clouds, Whewell's translation.

60. DAY, MONTH, AND YEAR.--If the day, the month, and the year are to be
used concurrently, it is necessary to determine how many days are
contained in the month and year, and when this has been done by the
astronomer the numbers are found to be very awkward and inconvenient for
daily use; and much of the history of chronology consists in an account
of the various devices by which ingenious men have sought to use
integral numbers to replace the cumbrous decimal fractions which follow.

According to Professor Harkness, for the epoch 1900 A. D.--

    One tropical year = 365.242197 mean solar days.
     "     "      "   = 365d. 5h. 48m. 45.8s.
    One lunation      = 29.530588 mean solar days.
     "     "          = 29d. 12h. 44m. 2.8s.

The word _lunation_ means the average interval from one new moon to the
next one--i. e., the time required by the moon to go from conjunction
with the sun round to conjunction again.

A very ancient device was to call a year equal to 365 days, and to have
months alternately of 29 and 30 days in length, but this was
unsatisfactory in more than one way. At the end of four years this
artificial calendar would be about one day ahead of the true one, at the
end of forty years ten days in error, and within a single lifetime the
seasons would have appreciably changed their position in the year, April
weather being due in March, according to the calendar. So, too, the year
under this arrangement did not consist of any integral number of months,
12 months of the average length of 29.5 days being 354 days, and 13
months 383.5 days, thus making any particular month change its position
from the beginning to the middle and the end of the year within a
comparatively short time. Some peoples gave up the astronomical year as
an independent unit and adopted a conventional year of 12 lunar months,
354 days, which is now in use in certain Mohammedan countries, where it
is known as the wandering year, with reference to the changing positions
of the seasons in such a year. Others held to the astronomical year and
adopted a system of conventional months, such that twelve of them would
just make up a year, as is done to this day in our own calendar, whose
months of arbitrary length we are compelled to remember by some such
jingle as the following:

    "Thirty days hath September,
    April, June, and November;
    All the rest have thirty-one
    Save February,
    Which alone hath twenty-eight,
    Till leap year gives it twenty-nine."


61. THE CALENDAR.--The foundations of our calendar may fairly be
ascribed to Julius Cæsar, who, under the advice of the Egyptian
astronomer Sosigines, adopted the old Egyptian device of a leap year,
whereby every fourth year was to consist of 366 days, while ordinary
years were only 365 days long. He also placed the beginning of the year
at the first of January, instead of in March, where it had formerly
been, and gave his own name, Julius, to the month which we now call
July. August was afterward named in honor of his successor, Augustus.
The names of the earlier months of the year are drawn from Roman
mythology; those of the later months, September, October, etc., meaning
seventh month, eighth month, represent the places of these months in the
year, before Cæsar's reformation, and also their places in some of the
subsequent calendars, for the widest diversity of practice existed
during mediæval times with regard to the day on which the new year
should begin, Christmas, Easter, March 25th, and others having been
employed at different times and places.

The system of leap years introduced by Cæsar makes the average length of
a year 365.25 days, which differs by about eleven minutes from the true
length of the tropical year, a difference so small that for ordinary
purposes no better approximation to the true length of the year need be
desired. But _any_ deviation from the true length, however small, must
in the course of time shift the seasons, the vernal and autumnal
equinox, to another part of the year, and the ecclesiastical authorities
of mediæval Europe found here ground for objection to Cæsar's calendar,
since the great Church festival of Easter has its date determined with
reference to the vernal equinox, and with the lapse of centuries Easter
became more and more displaced in the calendar, until Pope Gregory XIII,
late in the sixteenth century, decreed another reformation, whereby ten
days were dropped from the calendar, the day after March 11th being
called March 21st, to bring back the vernal equinox to the date on which
it fell in A. D. 325, the time of the Council of Nicæa, which Gregory
adopted as the fundamental epoch of his calendar.

The calendar having thus been brought back into agreement with that of
old time, Gregory purposed to keep it in such agreement for the future
by modifying Cæsar's leap-year rule so that it should run: Every year
whose number is divisible by 4 shall be a leap year except those years
whose numbers are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400. These
latter years--e. g., 1900--are counted as common years. The calendar
thus altered is called Gregorian to distinguish it from the older,
Julian calendar, and it found speedy acceptance in those civilized
countries whose Church adhered to Rome; but the Protestant powers were
slow to adopt it, and it was introduced into England and her American
colonies by act of Parliament in the year 1752, nearly two centuries
after Gregory's time. In Russia the Julian calendar has remained in
common use to our own day, but in commercial affairs it is there
customary to write the date according to both calendars--e. g., July
4/16, and at the present time strenuous exertions are making in that
country for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar to the complete
exclusion of the Julian one.

The Julian and Gregorian calendars are frequently represented by the
abbreviations O. S. and N. S., old style, new style, and as the older
historical dates are usually expressed in O. S., it is sometimes
convenient to transform a date from the one calendar to the other. This
is readily done by the formula

    G = J + (N - 2) - N/4,

where _G_ and _J_ are the respective dates, _N_ is the number of the
century, and the remainder is to be neglected in the division by 4. For
September 3, 1752, O. S., we have

        J = Sept. 3
    N - 2 = + 15
    - N/4 = -  4
    ------------------
        G = Sept. 14

and September 14 is the date fixed by act of Parliament to correspond to
September 3, 1752, O. S. Columbus discovered America on October 12,
1492, O. S. What is the corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar?

62. THE DAY OF THE WEEK.--A problem similar to the above but more
complicated consists in finding the day of the week on which any given
date of the Gregorian calendar falls--e. g., October 21, 1492.

The formula for this case is

    7q + r = Y + D + (Y - 1)/4 - (Y - 1)/100 + (Y - 1)/400

where _Y_ denotes the given year, _D_ the number of the day (date) in
that year, and _q_ and _r_ are respectively the quotient and the
remainder obtained by dividing the second member of the equation by 7.
If _r_ = 1 the date falls on Sunday, etc., and if _r_ = 0 the day is
Saturday. For the example suggested above we have

      Jan.  31
      Feb.  29
      Mch.  31
      April 30
      May   31
      June  30
      July  31
      Aug.  31
      Sept. 30
      Oct.  21
           ---
       D = 295

                  Y =  1492
                + D = + 295
    + (Y - 1) ÷   4 = + 372
    - (Y - 1) ÷ 100 = -  14
    + (Y - 1) ÷ 400 = +   3
                     -------
                    7) 2148

                  _q_ =   306
                  _r_ =     6 = Friday.

Find from some history the day of the week on which Columbus first saw
America, and compare this with the above.

On what day of the week did last Christmas fall? On what day of the week
were you born? In the formula for the day of the week why does _q_ have
the coefficient 7? What principles in the calendar give rise to the
divisors 4, 100, 400?

For much curious and interesting information about methods of reckoning
the lapse of time the student may consult the articles Calendar and
Chronology in any good encyclopædia.

CHAPTER VII

ECLIPSES


63. THE NATURE OF ECLIPSES.--Every planet has a shadow which travels
with the planet along its orbit, always pointing directly away from the
sun, and cutting off from a certain region of space the sunlight which
otherwise would fill it. For the most part these shadows are invisible,
but occasionally one of them falls upon a planet or some other body
which shines by reflected sunlight, and, cutting off its supply of
light, produces the striking phenomenon which we call an eclipse. The
satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars are eclipsed whenever they
plunge into the shadows cast by their respective planets, and Jupiter
himself is partially eclipsed when one of his own satellites passes
between him and the sun, and casts upon his broad surface a shadow too
small to cover more than a fraction of it.

But the eclipses of most interest to us are those of the sun and moon,
called respectively solar and lunar eclipses. In Fig. 33 the full moon,
_M´_, is shown immersed in the shadow cast by the earth, and therefore
eclipsed, and in the same figure the new moon, _M_, is shown as casting
its shadow upon the earth and producing an eclipse of the sun. From a
mere inspection of the figure we may learn that an eclipse of the sun
can occur only at new moon--i. e., when the moon is on line between the
earth and sun--and an eclipse of the moon can occur only at full moon.
Why? Also, the eclipsed moon, _M´_, will present substantially the same
appearance from every part of the earth where it is at all visible--the
same from North America as from South America--but the eclipsed sun
will present very different aspects from different parts of the earth.
Thus, at _L_, within the moon's shadow, the sunlight will be entirely
cut off, producing what is called a total eclipse. At points of the
earth's surface near _J_ and _K_ there will be no interference whatever
with the sunlight, and no eclipse, since the moon is quite off the line
joining these regions to any part of the sun. At places between _J_ and
_L_ or _K_ and _L_ the moon will cut off a part of the sun's light, but
not all of it, and will produce what is called a partial eclipse, which,
as seen from the northern parts of the earth, will be an eclipse of the
lower (southern) part of the sun, and as seen from the southern
hemisphere will be an eclipse of the northern part of the sun.

[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Different kinds of eclipse.]

The moon revolves around the earth in a plane, which, in the figure, we
suppose to be perpendicular to the surface of the paper, and to pass
through the sun along the line _M´ M_ produced. But it frequently
happens that this plane is turned to one side of the sun, along some
such line as _P Q_, and in this case the full moon would cut through the
edge of the earth's shadow without being at any time wholly immersed in
it, giving a partial eclipse of the moon, as is shown in the figure.

In what parts of the earth would this eclipse be visible? What kinds of
solar eclipse would be produced by the new moon at _Q_? In what parts of
the earth would they be visible?

64. THE SHADOW CONE.--The shape and position of the earth's shadow are
indicated in Fig. 33 by the lines drawn tangent to the circles which
represent the sun and earth, since it is only between these lines that
the earth interferes with the free radiation of sunlight, and since both
sun and earth are spheres, and the earth is much the smaller of the two,
it is evident that the earth's shadow must be, in geometrical language,
a cone whose base is at the earth, and whose vertex lies far to the
right of the figure--in other words, the earth's shadow, although very
long, tapers off finally to a point and ends. So, too, the shadow of the
moon is a cone, having its base at the moon and its vertex turned away
from the sun, and, as shown in the figure, just about long enough to
reach the earth.

It is easily shown, by the theorem of similar triangles in connection
with the known size of the earth and sun, that the distance from the
center of the earth to the vertex of its shadow is always equal to the
distance of the earth from the sun divided by 108, and, similarly, that
the length of the moon's shadow is equal to the distance of the moon
from the sun divided by 400, the moon's shadow being the smaller and
shorter of the two, because the moon is smaller than the earth. The
radius of the moon's orbit is just about 1/400th part of the radius of
the earth's orbit--i. e., the distance of the moon from the earth is
1/400th part of the distance of the earth from the sun, and it is this
"chance" agreement between the length of the moon's shadow and the
distance of the moon from the earth which makes the tip of the moon's
shadow fall very near the earth at the time of solar eclipses. Indeed,
the elliptical shape of the moon's orbit produces considerable
variations in the distance of the moon from the earth, and in
consequence of these variations the vertex of the shadow sometimes falls
short of reaching the earth, and sometimes even projects considerably
beyond its farther side. When the moon's distance is too great for the
shadow to bridge the space between earth and moon there can be no total
eclipse of the sun, for there is no shadow which can fall upon the
earth, even though the moon does come directly between earth and sun.
But there is then produced a peculiar kind of partial eclipse called
_annular_, or ring-shaped, because the moon, although eclipsing the
central parts of the sun, is not large enough to cover the whole of it,
but leaves the sun's edge visible as a ring of light, which completely
surrounds the moon. Although, strictly speaking, this is only a partial
eclipse, it is customary to put total and annular eclipses together in
one class, which is called central eclipses, since in these eclipses the
line of centers of sun and moon strikes the earth, while in ordinary
partial eclipses it passes to one side of the earth without striking it.
In this latter case we have to consider another cone called the
_penumbra_--i. e., partial shadow--which is shown in Fig. 33 by the
broken lines tangent to the sun and moon, and crossing at the point _V_,
which is the vertex of this cone. This penumbral cone includes within
its surface all that region of space within which the moon cuts off any
of the sunlight, and of course it includes the shadow cone which
produces total eclipses. Wherever the penumbra falls there will be a
solar eclipse of some kind, and the nearer the place is to the axis of
the penumbra, the more nearly total will be the eclipse. Since the moon
stands about midway between the earth and the vertex of the penumbra,
the diameter of the penumbra where it strikes the earth will be about
twice as great as the diameter of the moon, and the student should be
able to show from this that the region of the earth's surface within
which a partial solar eclipse is visible extends in a straight line
about 2,100 miles on either side of the region where the eclipse is
total. Measured along the curved surface of the earth, this distance is
frequently much greater.

Is it true that if at any time the axis of the shadow cone comes within
2,100 miles of the earth's surface a partial eclipse will be visible in
those parts of the earth nearest the axis of the shadow?

65. DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF LUNAR AND SOLAR ECLIPSES.--One marked
difference between lunar and solar eclipses which has been already
suggested, may be learned from Fig. 33. The full moon, _M´_, will be
seen eclipsed from every part of the earth where it is visible at all at
the time of the eclipse--that is, from the whole night side of the
earth; while the eclipsed sun will be seen eclipsed only from those
parts of the day side of the earth upon which the moon's shadow or
penumbra falls. Since the point of the shadow at best but little more
than reaches to the earth, the amount of space upon the earth which it
can cover at any one moment is very small, seldom more than 100 to 200
miles in length, and it is only within the space thus actually covered
by the shadow that the sun is at any given moment totally eclipsed, but
within this region the sun disappears, absolutely, behind the solid body
of the moon, leaving to view only such outlying parts and appendages as
are too large for the moon to cover. At a lunar eclipse, on the other
hand, the earth coming between sun and moon cuts off the light from the
latter, but, curiously enough, does not cut it off so completely that
the moon disappears altogether from sight even in mid-eclipse. The
explanation of this continued visibility is furnished by the broken
lines extending, in Fig. 33, from the earth through the moon. These
represent sunlight, which, entering the earth's atmosphere near the edge
of the earth (edge as seen from sun and moon), passes through it and
emerges in a changed direction, refracted, into the shadow cone and
feebly illumines the moon's surface with a ruddy light like that often
shown in our red sunsets. Eclipse and sunset alike show that when the
sun's light shines through dense layers of air it is the red rays which
come through most freely, and the attentive observer may often see at a
clear sunset something which corresponds exactly to the bending of the
sunlight into the shadow cone; just before the sun reaches the horizon
its disk is distorted from a circle into an oval whose horizontal
diameter is longer than the vertical one (see § 50).

QUERY.--At a total lunar eclipse what would be the effect upon the
appearance of the moon if the atmosphere around the edge of the earth
were heavily laden with clouds?

66. THE TRACK OF THE SHADOW.--We may regard the moon's shadow cone as a
huge pencil attached to the moon, moving with it along its orbit in the
direction of the arrowhead (Fig. 34), and as it moves drawing a black
line across the face of the earth at the time of total eclipse. This
black line is the path of the shadow and marks out those regions within
which the eclipse will be total at some stage of its progress. If the
point of the shadow just reaches the earth its trace will have no
sensible width, while, if the moon is nearer, the point of the cone will
be broken off, and, like a blunt pencil, it will draw a broad streak
across the earth, and this under the most favorable circumstances may
have a breadth of a little more than 160 miles and a length of 10,000 or
12,000 miles. The student should be able to show from the known distance
of the moon (240,000 miles) and the known interval between consecutive
new moons (29.5 days) that on the average the moon's shadow sweeps past
the earth at the rate of 2,100 miles per hour, and that in a general way
this motion is from west to east, since that is the direction of the
moon's motion in its orbit. The actual velocity with which the moon's
shadow moves past a given station may, however, be considerably greater
or less than this, since on the one hand when the shadow falls very
obliquely, as when the eclipse occurs near sunrise or sunset, the
shifting of the shadow will be very much greater than the actual motion
of the moon which produces it, and on the other hand the earth in
revolving upon its axis carries the spectator and the ground upon which
he stands along the same direction in which the shadow is moving. At the
equator, with the sun and moon overhead, this motion of the earth
subtracts about 1,000 miles per hour from the velocity with which the
shadow passes by. It is chiefly on this account, the diminished velocity
with which the shadow passes by, that total solar eclipses last longer
in the tropics than in higher latitudes, but even under the most
favorable circumstances the duration of totality does not reach eight
minutes at any one place, although it may take the shadow several hours
to sweep the entire length of its path across the earth.

According to Whitmell the greatest possible duration of a total solar
eclipse is 7m. 40s., and it can attain this limit only when the eclipse
occurs near the beginning of July and is visible at a place 5° north of
the equator.

The duration of a lunar eclipse depends mainly upon the position of the
moon with respect to the earth's shadow. If it strikes the shadow
centrally, as at _M´_, Fig. 33, a total eclipse may last for about two
hours, with an additional hour at the beginning and end, during which
the moon is entering and leaving the earth's shadow. If the moon meets
the shadow at one side of the axis, as at _P_, the total phase of the
eclipse may fail altogether, and between these extremes the duration of
totality may be anything from two hours downward.

[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Relation of the lunar nodes to eclipses.]

67. RELATION OF THE LUNAR NODES TO ECLIPSES.--To show why the moon
sometimes encounters the earth's shadow centrally and more frequently at
full moon passes by without touching it at all, we resort to Fig. 34,
which represents a part of the orbit of the earth about the sun, with
dates showing the time in each year at which the earth passes the part
of its orbit thus marked. The orbit of the moon about the earth, _M M´_,
is also shown, with the new moon, _M_, casting its shadow toward the
earth and the full moon, _M´_, apparently immersed in the earth's
shadow. But here appearances are deceptive, and the student who has
made the observations set forth in Chapter III has learned for himself
a fact of which careful account must now be taken. The apparent paths of
the moon and sun among the stars are great circles which lie near each
other, but are not exactly the same; and since these great circles are
only the intersections of the sky with the planes of the earth's orbit
and the moon's orbit, we see that these planes are slightly inclined to
each other and must therefore intersect along some line passing through
the center of the earth. This line, _N´ N´´_, is shown in the figure,
and if we suppose the surface of the paper to represent the plane of the
earth's orbit, we shall have to suppose the moon's orbit to be tipped
around this line, so that the left side of the orbit lies above and the
right side below the surface of the paper. But since the earth's shadow
lies in the plane of its orbit--i. e., in the surface of the paper--the
full moon of March, _M´_, must have passed below the shadow, and the new
moon, _M_, must have cast its shadow above the earth, so that neither a
lunar nor a solar eclipse could occur in that month. But toward the end
of May the earth and moon have reached a position where the line
_N´ N´´_ points almost directly toward the sun, in line with the shadow
cones which hide it. Note that the line _N´ N´´_ remains very nearly
parallel to its original position, while the earth is moving along its
orbit. The full moon will now be very near this line and therefore very
close to the plane of the earth's orbit, if not actually in it, and must
pass through the shadow of the earth and be eclipsed. So also the new
moon will cast its shadow in the plane of the ecliptic, and this shadow,
falling upon the earth, produced the total solar eclipse of May 28,
1900.

_N´ N´´_ is called the line of nodes of the moon's orbit (§ 39), and the
two positions of the earth in its orbit, diametrically opposite each
other, at which _N´ N´´_ points exactly toward the sun, we shall call
the _nodes_ of the lunar orbit. Strictly speaking, the nodes are those
points of the sky against which the moon's center is projected at the
moment when in its orbital motion it cuts through the plane of the
earth's orbit. Bearing in mind these definitions, we may condense much
of what precedes into the proposition: Eclipses of either sun or moon
can occur only when the earth is at or near one of the nodes of the
moon's orbit. Corresponding to these positions of the earth there are in
each year two seasons, about six months apart, at which times, and at
these only, eclipses can occur. Thus in the year 1900 the earth passed
these two points on June 2d and November 24th respectively, and the
following list of eclipses which occurred in that year shows that all of
them were within a few days of one or the other of these dates:

        _Eclipses of the Year 1900_

    Total solar eclipse          May 28th.
    Partial lunar eclipse        June 12th.
    Annular (solar) eclipse      November 21st.

68. ECLIPSE LIMITS.--If the earth is exactly at the node at the time of
new moon, the moon's shadow will fall centrally upon it and will produce
an eclipse visible within the torrid zone, since this is that part of
the earth's surface nearest the plane of its orbit. If the earth is near
but not at the node, the new moon will stand a little north or south of
the plane of the earth's orbit, and its shadow will strike the earth
farther north or south than before, producing an eclipse in the
temperate or frigid zones; or the shadow may even pass entirely above or
below the earth, producing no eclipse whatever, or at most a partial
eclipse visible near the north or south pole. Just how many days' motion
the earth may be away from the node and still permit an eclipse is shown
in the following brief table of eclipse limits, as they are called:

                  _Solar Eclipse Limits_

  If at any new moon the earth is

  Less than 10 days away from a node, a central eclipse is certain.
  Between 10 and 16 days   "  "  "    some kind of eclipse is certain.
  Between 16 and 19 days   "  "  "    a partial eclipse is possible.
  More than 19 days        "  "  "    no eclipse is possible.

                _Lunar Eclipse Limits_

  If at any full moon the earth is

  Less than 4 days away from a node, a total eclipse is certain.
  Between 4 and 10 days   "  "  "    some kind of eclipse is certain.
  Between 10 and 14 days  "  "  "    a partial eclipse is possible.
  More than 14 days       "  "  "    no eclipse is possible.

From this table of eclipse limits we may draw some interesting
conclusions about the frequency with which eclipses occur.

69. NUMBER OF ECLIPSES IN A YEAR.--Whenever the earth passes a node of
the moon's orbit a new moon must occur at some time during the 2 × 16
days that the earth remains inside the limits where some kind of eclipse
is certain, and there must therefore be an eclipse of the sun every time
the earth passes a node of the moon's orbit. But, since there are two
nodes past which the earth moves at least once in each year, there must
be at least two solar eclipses every year. Can there be more than two?
On the average, will central or partial eclipses be the more numerous?

A similar line of reasoning will not hold true for eclipses of the moon,
since it is quite possible that no full moon should occur during the 20
days required by the earth to move past the node from the western to the
eastern limit. This omission of a full moon while the earth is within
the eclipse limits sometimes happens at both nodes in the same year, and
then we have a year with no eclipse of the moon. The student may note in
the list of eclipses for 1900 that the partial lunar eclipse of June
12th occurred 10 days after the earth passed the node, and was therefore
within the doubtful zone where eclipses may occur and may fail, and
corresponding to this position the eclipse was a very small one, only a
thousandth part of the moon's diameter dipping into the shadow of the
earth. By so much the year 1900 escaped being an illustration of a year
in which no lunar eclipse occurred.

A partial eclipse of the moon will usually occur about a fortnight
before or after a total eclipse of the sun, since the full moon will
then be within the eclipse limit at the opposite node. A partial eclipse
of the sun will always occur about a fortnight before or after a total
eclipse of the moon.

[Illustration: FIG. 35.--The eclipse of May 28, 1900.]

70. ECLIPSE MAPS.--It is the custom of astronomers to prepare, in
advance of the more important eclipses, maps showing the trace of the
moon's shadow across the earth, and indicating the times of beginning
and ending of the eclipses, as is shown in Fig. 35. While the actual
construction of such a map requires much technical knowledge, the
principles involved are simple enough: the straight line passed through
the center of sun and moon is the axis of the shadow cone, and the map
contains little more than a graphical representation of when and where
this cone meets the surface of the earth. Thus in the map, the "Path of
Total Eclipse" is the trace of the shadow cone across the face of the
earth, and the width of this path shows that the earth encountered the
shadow considerably inside the vertex of the cone. The general direction
of the path is from west to east, and the slight sinuousities which it
presents are for the most part due to unavoidable distortion of the
map caused by the attempt to represent the curved surface of the earth
upon the flat surface of the paper. On either side of the Path of Total
Eclipse is the region within which the eclipse was only partial, and the
broken lines marked Begins at 3h., Ends at 3h., show the intersection of
the penumbral cone with the surface of the earth at 3 P. M., Greenwich
time. These two lines inclose every part of the earth's surface from
which at that time any eclipse whatever could be seen, and at this
moment the partial eclipse was just beginning at every point on the
eastern edge of the penumbra and just ending at every point on the
western edge, while at the center of the penumbra, on the Path of Total
Eclipse, lay the shadow of the moon, an oval patch whose greatest
diameter was but little more than 60 miles in length, and within which
lay every part of the earth where the eclipse was total at that moment.

The position of the penumbra at other hours is also shown on the map,
although with more distortion, because it then meets the surface of the
earth more obliquely, and from these lines it is easy to obtain the time
of beginning and end of the eclipse at any desired place, and to
estimate by the distance of the place from the Path of Total Eclipse how
much of the sun's face was obscured.

Let the student make these "predictions" for Washington, Chicago,
London, and Algiers.

The points in the map marked First Contact, Last Contact, show the
places at which the penumbral cone first touched the earth and finally
left it. According to computations made as a basis for the construction
of the map the Greenwich time of First Contact was 0h. 12.5m. and of
Last Contact 5h. 35.6m., and the difference between these two times
gives the total duration of the eclipse upon the earth--i. e., 5 hours
23.1 minutes.

[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Central eclipses for the first two decades of
the twentieth century. OPPOLZER.]

71. FUTURE ECLIPSES.--An eclipse map of a different kind is shown in
Fig. 36, which represents the shadow paths of all the central eclipses
of the sun, visible during the period 1900-1918 A. D., in those parts of
the earth north of the south temperate zone. Each continuous black line
shows the path of the shadow in a total eclipse, from its beginning, at
sunrise, at the western end of the line to its end, sunset, at the
eastern end, the little circle near the middle of the line showing the
place at which the eclipse was total at noon. The broken lines represent
similar data for the annular eclipses. This map is one of a series
prepared by the Austrian astronomer, Oppolzer, showing the path of every
such eclipse from the year 1200 B. C. to 2160 A. D., a period of more
than three thousand years.

If we examine the dates of the eclipses shown in this map we shall find
that they are not limited to the particular seasons, May and November,
in which those of the year 1900 occurred, but are scattered through all
the months of the year, from January to December. This shows at once
that the line of nodes, _N´ N´´_, of Fig. 34, does not remain in a fixed
position, but turns round in the plane of the earth's orbit so that in
different years the earth reaches the node in different months. The
precession has already furnished us an illustration of a similar change,
the slow rotation of the earth's axis, producing a corresponding
shifting of the line in which the planes of the equator and ecliptic
intersect; and in much the same way, through the disturbing influence of
the sun's attraction, the line _N´ N´´_ is made to revolve westward,
opposite to the arrowheads in Fig. 34, at the rate of nearly 20° per
year, so that the earth comes to each node about 19 days earlier in each
year than in the year preceding, and the eclipse season in each year
comes on the average about 19 days earlier than in the year before,
although there is a good deal of irregularity in the amount of change in
particular years.

72. RECURRENCE OF ECLIPSES.--Before the beginning of the Christian era
astronomers had found out a rough-and-ready method of predicting
eclipses, which is still of interest and value. The substance of the
method is that if we start with any eclipse whatever--e. g., the eclipse
of May 28, 1900--and reckon forward or backward from that date a period
of 18 years and 10 or 11 days, we shall find another eclipse quite
similar in its general characteristics to the one with which we started.
Thus, from the map of eclipses (Fig. 36), we find that a total solar
eclipse will occur on June 8, 1918, 18 years and 11 days after the one
illustrated in Fig. 35. This period of 18 years and 11 days is called
_saros_, an ancient word which means cycle or repetition, and since
every eclipse is repeated after the lapse of a saros, we may find the
dates of all the eclipses of 1918 by adding 11 days to the dates given
in the table of eclipses for 1900 (§ 67), and it is to be especially
noted that each eclipse of 1918 will be like its predecessor of 1900 in
character--lunar, solar, partial, total, etc. The eclipses of any year
may be predicted by a similar reference to those which occurred eighteen
years earlier. Consult a file of old almanacs.

The exact length of a saros is 223 lunar months, each of which is a
little more than 29.5 days long, and if we multiply the exact value of
this last number (see § 60) by 223, we shall find for the product
6,585.32 days, which is equal to 18 years 11.32 days when there are four
leap years included in the 18, or 18 years 10.32 days when the number of
leap years is five; and in applying the saros to the prediction of
eclipses, due heed must be paid to the number of intervening leap years.
To explain why eclipses are repeated at the end of the saros, we note
that the occurrence of an eclipse depends solely upon the relative
positions of the earth, moon, and node of the moon's orbit, and the
eclipse will be repeated as often as these three come back to the
position which first produced it. This happens at the end of every
saros, since the saros is, approximately, the least common multiple of
the length of the year, the length of the lunar month, and the length of
time required by the line of nodes to make a complete revolution around
the ecliptic. If the saros were exactly a multiple of these three
periods, every eclipse would be repeated over and over again for
thousands of years; but such is not the case, the saros is not an exact
multiple of a year, nor is it an exact multiple of the time required for
a revolution of the line of nodes, and in consequence the restitution
which comes at the end of the saros is not a perfect one. The earth at
the 223d new moon is in fact about half a day's motion farther west,
relative to the node, than it was at the beginning, and the resulting
eclipse, while very similar, is not precisely the same as before. After
another 18 years, at the second repetition, the earth is a day farther
from the node than at first, and the eclipse differs still more in
character, etc. This is shown in Fig. 37, which represents the apparent
positions of the disks of the sun and moon as seen from the center of
the earth at the end of each sixth saros, 108 years, where the upper row
of figures represents the number of repetitions of the eclipse from the
beginning, marked _0_, to the end, _72_. The solar eclipse limits, 10,
16, 19 days, are also shown, and all those eclipses which fall between
the 10-day limits will be central as seen from some part of the earth,
those between 16 and 19 partial wherever seen, while between 10 and 16
they may be either total or partial. Compare the figure with the
following description given by Professor Newcomb: "A series of such
eclipses commences with a very small eclipse near one pole of the earth.
Gradually increasing for about eleven recurrences, it will become
central near the same pole. Forty or more central eclipses will then
recur, the central line moving slowly toward the other pole. The series
will then become partial, and finally cease. The entire duration of the
series will be more than a thousand years. A new series commences, on
the average, at intervals of thirty years."

[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Graphical illustration of the saros.]

A similar figure may be constructed to represent the recurrence of lunar
eclipses; but here, in consequence of the smaller eclipse limits, we
shall find that a series is of shorter duration, a little over eight
centuries as compared with twelve centuries, which is the average
duration of a series of solar eclipses.

One further matter connected with the saros deserves attention. During
the period of 6,585.32 days the earth has 6,585 times turned toward the
sun the same face upon which the moon's shadow fell at the beginning of
the saros, but at the end of the saros the odd 0.32 of a day gives the
earth time to make about a third of a revolution more before the eclipse
is repeated, and in consequence the eclipse is seen in a different
region of the earth, on the average about 116° farther west in
longitude. Compare in Fig. 36 the regions in which the eclipses of 1900
and 1918 are visible.

Is this change in the region where the repeated eclipse is visible, true
of lunar eclipses as well as solar?

73. USE OF ECLIPSES.--At all times and among all peoples eclipses, and
particularly total eclipses of the sun, have been reckoned among the
most impressive phenomena of Nature. In early times and among
uncultivated people they were usually regarded with apprehension, often
amounting to a terror and frenzy, which civilized travelers have not
scrupled to use for their own purposes with the aid of the eclipse
predictions contained in their almanacs, threatening at the proper time
to destroy the sun or moon, and pointing to the advancing eclipse as
proof that their threats were not vain. In our own day and our own land
these feelings of awe have not quite disappeared, but for the most part
eclipses are now awaited with an interest and pleasure which, contrasted
with the former feelings of mankind, furnish one of the most striking
illustrations of the effect of scientific knowledge in transforming
human fear and misery into a sense of security and enjoyment.

But to the astronomer an eclipse is more than a beautiful illustration
of the working of natural laws; it is in varying degree an opportunity
of adding to his store of knowledge respecting the heavenly bodies. The
region immediately surrounding the sun is at most times closed to
research by the blinding glare of the sun's own light, so that a planet
as large as the moon might exist here unseen were it not for the
occasional opportunity presented by a total eclipse which shuts off the
excessive light and permits not only a search for unknown planets but
for anything and everything which may exist around the sun. More than
one astronomer has reported the discovery of such planets, and at least
one of these has found a name and a description in some of the books,
but at the present time most astronomers are very skeptical about the
existence of any such object of considerable size, although there is
some reason to believe that an enormous number of little bodies, ranging
in size from grains of sand upward, do move in this region, as yet
unseen and offering to the future problems for investigation.

But in other directions the study of this region at the times of total
eclipse has yielded far larger returns, and in the chapter on the sun we
shall have to consider the marvelous appearances presented by the solar
prominences and by the corona, an appendage of the sun which reaches out
from his surface for millions of miles but is never seen save at an
eclipse. Photographs of the corona are taken by astronomers at every
opportunity, and reproductions of some of these may be found in Chapter
X.

Annular eclipses and lunar eclipses are of comparatively little
consequence, but any recorded eclipse may become of value in connection
with chronology. We date our letters in a particular year of the
twentieth century, and commonly suppose that the years are reckoned from
the birth of Christ; but this is an error, for the eclipses which were
observed of old and by the chroniclers have been associated with events
of his life, when examined by the astronomers are found quite
inconsistent with astronomic theory. They are, however, reconciled with
it if we assume that our system of dates has its origin four years after
the birth of Christ, or, in other words, that Christ was born in the
year 4 B. C. A mistake was doubtless made at the time the Christian era
was introduced into chronology. At many other points the chance record
of an eclipse in the early annals of civilization furnishes a similar
means of controlling and correcting the dates assigned by the historian
to events long past.




CHAPTER VIII

INSTRUMENTS AND THE PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN THEIR USE


74. TWO FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS.--In previous chapters we have seen that a
clock and a divided circle (protractor) are needed for the observations
which an astronomer makes, and it is worth while to note here that the
geography of the sky and the science of celestial motions depend
fundamentally upon these two instruments. The protractor is a simple
instrument, a humble member of the family of divided circles, but untold
labor and ingenuity have been expended on this family to make possible
the construction of a circle so accurately divided that with it angles
may be measured to the tenth of a second instead of to the tenth of a
degree--i. e., 3,600 times as accurate as the protractor furnishes.

The building of a good clock is equally important and has cost a like
amount of labor and pains, so that it is a far cry from Galileo and his
discovery that a pendulum "keeps time" to the modern clock with its
accurate construction and elaborate provision against disturbing
influences of every kind. Every such timepiece, whether it be of the
nutmeg variety which sells for a dollar, or whether it be the standard
clock of a great national observatory, is made up of the same essential
parts that fall naturally into four classes, which we may compare with
the departments of a well-ordered factory: I. A timekeeping department,
the pendulum or balance spring, whose oscillations must all be of equal
duration. II. A power department, the weights or mainspring, which,
when wound, store up the power applied from outside and give it out
piecemeal as required to keep the first department running. III. A
publication department, the dial and hands, which give out the time
furnished by Department I. IV. A transportation department, the wheels,
which connect the other three and serve as a means of transmitting power
and time from one to the other. The case of either clock or watch is
merely the roof which shelters it and forms no department of its
industry. Of these departments the first is by far the most important,
and its good or bad performance makes or mars the credit of the clock.
Beware of meddling with the balance wheel of your watch.

75. RADIANT ENERGY.--But we have now to consider other instruments which
in practice supplement or displace the simple apparatus hitherto
employed. Among the most important of these modern instruments are the
telescope, the spectroscope, and the photographic camera; and since all
these instruments deal with the light which comes from the stars to the
earth, we must for their proper understanding take account of the nature
of that light, or, more strictly speaking, we must take account of the
radiant energy emitted by the sun and stars, which energy, coming from
the sun, is translated by our nerves into the two different sensations
of light and heat. The radiant energy which comes from the stars is not
fundamentally different from that of the sun, but the amount of energy
furnished by any star is so small that it is unable to produce through
our nerves any sensible perception of heat, and for the same reason the
vast majority of stars are invisible to the unaided eye; they do not
furnish a sufficient amount of energy to affect the optic nerves. A hot
brick taken into the hand reveals its presence by the two different
sensations of heat and pressure (weight); but as there is only one brick
to produce the two sensations, so there is only one energy to produce
through its action upon different nerves the two sensations of light
and heat, and this energy is called _radiant_ because it appears to
stream forth radially from everything which has the capacity of emitting
it. For the detailed study of radiant energy the student is referred to
that branch of science called physics; but some of its elementary
principles may be learned through the following simple experiment, which
the student should not fail to perform for himself:

Drop a bullet or other similar object into a bucket of water and observe
the circular waves which spread from the place where it enters the
water. These waves are a form of radiant energy, but differing from
light or heat in that they are visibly confined to a single plane, the
surface of the water, instead of filling the entire surrounding space.
By varying the size of the bucket, the depth of the water, the weight of
the bullet, etc., different kinds of waves, big and little, may be
produced; but every such set of waves may be described and defined in
all its principal characteristics by means of three numbers--viz., the
vertical height of the waves from hollow to crest; the distance of one
wave from the next; and the velocity with which the waves travel across
the water. The last of these quantities is called the velocity of
propagation; the second is called the wave length; one half of the first
is called the amplitude; and all these terms find important applications
in the theory of light and heat.

The energy of the falling bullet, the disturbance which it produced on
entering the water, was carried by the waves from the center to the edge
of the bucket but not beyond, for the wave can go only so far as the
water extends. The transfer of energy in this way requires a perfectly
continuous medium through which the waves may travel, and the whole
visible universe is supposed to be filled with something called _ether_,
which serves everywhere as a medium for the transmission of radiant
energy just as the water in the experiment served as a medium for
transmitting in waves the energy furnished to it by the falling bullet.
The student may think of this energy as being transmitted in spherical
waves through the ether, every glowing body, such as a star, a candle
flame, an arc lamp, a hot coal, etc., being the origin and center of
such systems of waves, and determining by its own physical and chemical
properties the wave length and amplitude of the wave systems given off.

The intensity of any light depends upon the amplitude of the
corresponding vibration, and its color depends upon the wave length. By
ingenious devices which need not be here described it has been found
possible to measure the wave length corresponding to different
colors--e. g., all of the colors of the rainbow, and some of these wave
lengths expressed in tenth meters are as follows: A tenth meter is the
length obtained by dividing a meter into 10^{10} equal parts. 10^{10} =
10,000,000,000.

    Extreme limit of visible red         7,600

[Illustration: PLATE I. THE NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS]

The phrase "extreme limit of visible violet" or red used above must be
understood to mean that in general the eye is not able to detect radiant
energy having a wave length less than 3,900 or greater than 7,600 tenth
meters. Radiant energy, however, exists in waves of both greater and
shorter length than the above, and may be readily detected by apparatus
not subject to the limitations of the human eye--e. g., a common
thermometer will show a rise of temperature when its bulb is exposed to
radiant energy of wave length much greater than 7,600 tenth meters,
and a photographic plate will be strongly affected by energy of
shorter wave length than 3,900 tenth meters.

76. REFLECTION AND CONDENSATION OF WAVES.--When the waves produced by
dropping a bullet into a bucket of water meet the sides of the bucket,
they appear to rebound and are reflected back toward the center, and if
the bullet is dropped very near the center of the bucket the reflected
waves will meet simultaneously at this point and produce there by their
combined action a wave higher than that which was reflected at the walls
of the bucket. There has been a condensation of energy produced by the
reflection, and this increased energy is shown by the greater amplitude
of the wave. The student should not fail to notice that each portion of
the wave has traveled out and back over the radius of the bucket, and
that they meet simultaneously at the center because of this equality of
the paths over which they travel, and the resulting equality of time
required to go out and back. If the bullet were dropped at one side of
the center, would the reflected waves produce _at any point_ a
condensation of energy?

If the bucket were of elliptical instead of circular cross section and
the bullet were dropped at one focus of the ellipse there would be
produced a condensation of reflected energy at the other focus, since
the sum of the paths traversed by each portion of the wave before and
after reflection is equal to the sum of the paths traversed by every
other portion, and all parts of the wave reach the second focus at the
same time. Upon what geometrical principle does this depend?

The condensation of wave energy in the circular and elliptical buckets
are special cases under the general principle that such a condensation
will be produced at any point which is so placed that different parts of
the wave front reach it simultaneously, whether by reflection or by some
other means, as shown below.

The student will note that for the sake of greater precision we here
say _wave front_ instead of wave. If in any wave we imagine a line drawn
along the crest, so as to touch every drop which at that moment is
exactly at the crest, we shall have what is called a wave front, and
similarly a line drawn through the trough between two waves, or through
any set of drops similarly placed on a wave, constitutes a wave front.

77. MIRRORS AND LENSES.--That form of radiant energy which we recognize
as light and heat may be reflected and condensed precisely as are the
waves of water in the exercise considered above, but owing to the
extreme shortness of the wave length in this case the reflecting surface
should be very smooth and highly polished. A piece of glass hollowed out
in the center by grinding, and with a light film of silver chemically
deposited upon the hollow surface and carefully polished, is often used
by astronomers for this purpose, and is called a concave mirror.

The radiant energy coming from a star or other distant object and
falling upon the silvered face of such a mirror is reflected and
condensed at a point a little in front of the mirror, and there forms an
image of the star, which may be seen with the unaided eye, if it is held
in the right place, or may be examined through a magnifying glass.
Similarly, an image of the sun, a planet, or a distant terrestrial
object is formed by the mirror, which condenses at its appropriate place
the radiant energy proceeding from each and every point in the surface
of the object, and this, in common phrase, produces an image of the
object.

Another device more frequently used by astronomers for the production of
images (condensation of energy) is a lens which in its simplest form is
a round piece of glass, thick in the center and thin at the edge, with a
cross section, such as is shown at _A B_ in Fig. 38. If we suppose _E G
D_ to represent a small part of a wave front coming from a very distant
source of radiant energy, such as a star, this wave front will be
practically a plane surface represented by the straight line _E D_, but
in passing through the lens this surface will become warped, since light
travels slower in glass than in air, and the central part of the beam,
_G_, in its onward motion will be retarded by the thick center of the
lens, more than _E_ or _D_ will be retarded by the comparatively thin
outer edges of _A B_. On the right of the lens the wave front therefore
will be transformed into a curved surface whose exact character depends
upon the shape of the lens and the kind of glass of which it is made. By
properly choosing these the new wave front may be made a part of a
sphere having its center at the point _F_ and the whole energy of the
wave front, _E G D_, will then be condensed at _F_, because this point
is equally distant from all parts of the warped wave front, and
therefore is in a position to receive them simultaneously. The distance
of _F_ from _A B_ is called the focal length of the lens, and _F_ itself
is called the focus. The significance of this last word (Latin, _focus_
= fireplace) will become painfully apparent to the student if he will
hold a common reading glass between his hand and the sun in such a way
that the focus falls upon his hand.

[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Illustrating the theory of lenses.]

All the energy transmitted by the lens in the direction _G F_ is
concentrated upon a very small area at _F_, and an image of the
object--e. g., a star, from which the light came--is formed here. Other
stars situated near the one in question will also send beams of light
along slightly different directions to the lens, and these will be
concentrated, each in its appropriate place, in the _focal plane_,
_F H_, passed through the focus, _F_, perpendicular to the line, _F G_,
and we shall find in this plane a picture of all the stars or other
objects within the range of the lens.

[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Essential parts of a reflecting telescope.]

78. TELESCOPES.--The simplest kind of telescope consists of a concave
mirror to produce images, and a magnifying glass, called an _eyepiece_,
through which to examine them; but for convenience' sake, so that the
observer may not stand in his own light, a small mirror is frequently
added to this combination, as at _H_ in Fig. 39, where the lines
represent the directions along which the energy is propagated. By
reflection from this mirror the focal plane and the images are shifted
to _F_, where they may be examined from one side through the magnifying
glass _E_.

[Illustration: FIG. 40.--A simple form of refracting telescope.]

Such a combination of parts is called a _reflecting_ telescope, while
one in which the images are produced by a lens or combination of lenses
is called a _refracting_ telescope, the adjective having reference to
the bending, refraction, produced by the glass upon the direction in
which the energy is propagated. The customary arrangement of parts in
such a telescope is shown in Fig. 40, where the part marked _O_ is
called the objective and _V E_ (the magnifying glass) is the eyepiece,
or ocular, as it is sometimes called.

Most objects with which we have to deal in using a telescope send to it
not light of one color only, but a mixture of light of many colors,
many different wave lengths, some of which are refracted more than
others by the glass of which the lens is composed, and in consequence of
these different amounts of refraction a single lens does not furnish a
single image of a star, but gives a confused jumble of red and yellow
and blue images much inferior in sharpness of outline (definition) to
the images made by a good concave mirror. To remedy this defect it is
customary to make the objective of two or more pieces of glass of
different densities and ground to different shapes as is shown at _O_ in
Fig. 40. The two pieces of glass thus mounted in one frame constitute a
compound lens having its own focal plane, shown at _F_ in the figure,
and similarly the lenses composing the eyepiece have a focal plane
between the eyepiece and the objective which must also fall at _F_, and
in the use of a telescope the eyepiece must be pushed out or in until
its focal plane coincides with that of the objective. This process,
which is called focusing, is what is accomplished in the ordinary opera
glass by turning a screw placed between the two tubes, and it must be
carefully done with every telescope in order to obtain distinct vision.

79. MAGNIFYING POWER.--The amount by which a given telescope magnifies
depends upon the focal length of the objective (or mirror) and the focal
length of the eyepiece, and is equal to the ratio of these two
quantities. Thus in Fig. 40 the distance of the objective from the focal
plane _F_ is about 16 times as great as the distance of the eyepiece
from the same plane, and the magnifying power of this telescope is
therefore 16 diameters. A magnifying power of 16 diameters means that
the diameter of any object seen in the telescope looks 16 times as large
as it appears without the telescope, and is nearly equivalent to saying
that the object appears only one sixteenth as far off. Sometimes the
magnifying power is assumed to be the number of times that the _area_ of
an object seems increased; and since areas are proportional to the
squares of lines, the magnifying power of 16 diameters might be called
a power of 256. Every large telescope is provided with several eyepieces
of different focal lengths, ranging from a quarter of an inch to two and
a half inches, which are used to furnish different magnifying powers as
may be required for the different kinds of work undertaken with the
instrument. Higher powers can be used with large telescopes than with
small ones, but it is seldom advantageous to use with any telescope an
eyepiece giving a higher power than 60 diameters for each inch of
diameter of the objective.

The part played by the eyepiece in determining magnifying power will be
readily understood from the following experiment:

Make a pin hole in a piece of cardboard. Bring a printed page so close
to one eye that you can no longer see the letters distinctly, and then
place the pin hole between the eye and the page. The letters which were
before blurred may now be seen plainly through the pin hole, even when
the page is brought nearer to the eye than before. As it is brought
nearer, notice how the letters seem to become larger, solely because
they are nearer. A pin hole is the simplest kind of a magnifier, and the
eyepiece in a telescope plays the same part as does the pin hole in the
experiment; it enables the eye to be brought nearer to the image, and
the shorter the focal length of the eyepiece the nearer is the eye
brought to the image and the higher is the magnifying power.

80. THE EQUATORIAL MOUNTING.--Telescopes are of all sizes, from the
modest opera glass which may be carried in the pocket and which requires
no other support than the hand, to the giant which must have a special
roof to shelter it and elaborate machinery to support and direct it
toward the sky. But for even the largest telescopes this machinery
consists of the following parts, which are illustrated, with exception
of the last one, in the small equatorial telescope shown in Fig. 41. It
is not customary to place a driving clock on so small a telescope as
this:

(_a_) A supporting pier or tripod.

(_b_) An axis placed parallel to the axis of the earth.

(_c_) Another axis at right angles to _b_ and capable of revolving upon
_b_ as an axle.

(_d_) The telescope tube attached to _c_ and capable of revolving about
_c_.

(_e_) Graduated circles attached to _c_ and _b_ to measure the amount by
which the telescope is turned on these axes.

(_f_) A driving clock so connected with _b_ as to make _c_ (and _d_)
revolve about _b_ with an angular velocity equal and opposite to that
with which the earth turns upon its axis.

[Illustration: FIG. 41.--A simple equatorial mounting.]

[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Equatorial mounting of the great telescope of
the Yerkes Observatory.]

Such a support is called an equatorial mounting, and the student should
note from the figure that the circles, _e_, measure the hour angle and
declination of any star toward which the telescope is directed, and
conversely if the telescope be so set that these circles indicate the
hour angle and declination of any given star, the telescope will then
point toward that star. In this way it is easy to find with the
telescope any moderately bright star, even in broad daylight, although
it is then absolutely invisible to the naked eye. The rotation of the
earth about its axis will speedily carry the telescope away from the
star, but if the driving clock be started, its effect is to turn the
telescope toward the west just as fast as the earth's rotation carries
it toward the east, and by these compensating motions to keep it
directed toward the star. In Fig. 42, which represents the largest and
one of the most perfect refracting telescopes ever built, let the
student pick out and identify the several parts of the mounting above
described. A part of the driving clock may be seen within the head of
the pier. In Fig. 43 trace out the corresponding parts in the mounting
of a reflecting telescope.

[Illustration: FIG. 43.--The reflecting telescope of the Paris
Observatory.]

A telescope is often only a subordinate part of some instrument or
apparatus, and then its style of mounting is determined by the
requirements of the special case; but when the telescope is the chief
thing, and the remainder of the apparatus is subordinate to it, the
equatorial mounting is almost always adopted, although sometimes the
arrangement of the parts is very different in appearance from any of
those shown above. Beware of the popular error that an object held close
in front of a telescope can be seen by an observer at the eyepiece. The
numerous stories of astronomers who saw spiders crawling over the
objective of their telescope, and imagined they were beholding strange
objects in the sky, are all fictitious, since nothing on or near the
objective could possibly be seen through the telescope.

81. PHOTOGRAPHY.--A photographic camera consists of a lens and a device
for holding at its focus a specially prepared plate or film. This plate
carries a chemical deposit which is very sensitive to the action of
light, and which may be made to preserve the imprint of any picture
which the lens forms upon it. If such a sensitive plate is placed at the
focus of a reflecting telescope, the combination becomes a camera
available for astronomical photography, and at the present time the
tendency is strong in nearly every branch of astronomical research to
substitute the sensitive plate in place of the observer at a telescope.
A refracting telescope may also be used for astronomical photography,
and is very much used, but some complications occur here on account of
the resolution of the light into its constituent colors in passing
through the objective. Fig. 44 shows such a telescope, or rather two
telescopes, one photographic, the other visual, supported side by side
upon the same equatorial mounting.

Observatory.]

One of the great advantages of photography is found in connection with
what is called--

82. PERSONAL EQUATION.--It is a remarkable fact, first investigated by
the German astronomer Bessel, three quarters of a century ago, that
where extreme accuracy is required the human senses can not be
implicitly relied upon. The most skillful observers will not agree
exactly in their measurement of an angle or in estimating the exact
instant at which a star crossed the meridian; the most skillful artists
can not draw identical pictures of the same object, etc.

These minor deceptions of the senses are included in the term _personal
equation_, which is a famous phrase in astronomy, denoting that the
observations of any given person require to be corrected by means of
some equation involving his personality.

General health, digestion, nerves, fatigue, all influence the personal
equation, and it was in reference to such matters that one of the most
eminent of living astronomers has given this description of his habits
of observing:

"In order to avoid every physiological disturbance, I have adopted the
rule to abstain for one or two hours before commencing observations from
every laborious occupation; never to go to the telescope with stomach
loaded with food; to abstain from everything which could affect the
nervous system, from narcotics and alcohol, and especially from the
abuse of coffee, which I have found to be exceedingly prejudicial to the
accuracy of observation."[3] A regimen suggestive of preparation for an
athletic contest rather than for the more quiet labors of an astronomer.

83. VISUAL AND PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK.--The photographic plate has no stomach
and no nerves, and is thus free from many of the sources of error which
inhere in visual observations, and in special classes of work it
possesses other marked advantages, such as rapidity when many stars are
to be dealt with simultaneously, permanence of record, and owing to the
cumulative effect of long exposure of the plate it is possible to
photograph with a given telescope stars far too faint to be seen through
it. On the other hand, the eye has the advantage in some respects, such
as studying the minute details of a fairly bright object--e. g., the
surface of a planet, or the sun's corona and, for the present at least,
neither method of observing can exclude the other. For a remarkable case
of discordance between the results of photographic and visual
observations compare the pictures of the great nebula in the
constellation Andromeda, which are given in Chapter XIV. A partial
explanation of these discordances and other similar ones is that the eye
is most strongly affected by greenish-yellow light, while the
photographic plate responds most strongly to violet light; the
photograph, therefore, represents things which the eye has little
capacity for seeing, and _vice versa_.

84. THE SPECTROSCOPE.--In some respects the spectroscope is the exact
counterpart of the telescope. The latter condenses radiant energy and
the former disperses it. As a measuring instrument the telescope is
mainly concerned with the direction from which light comes, and the
different colors of which that light is composed affect it only as an
obstacle to be overcome in its construction. On the other hand, with the
spectroscope the direction from which the radiant energy comes is of
minor consequence, and the all-important consideration is the intrinsic
character of that radiation. What colors are present in the light and in
what proportions? What can these colors be made to tell about the nature
and condition of the body from which they come, be it sun, or star, or
some terrestrial source of light, such as an arc lamp, a candle flame,
or a furnace in blast? These are some of the characteristic questions of
the spectrum analysis, and, as the name implies, they are solved by
analyzing the radiant energy into its component parts, setting down the
blue light in one place, the yellow in another, the red in still
another, etc., and interpreting this array of colors by means of
principles which we shall have to consider. Something of this process of
color analysis may be seen in the brilliant hues shown by a soap bubble,
or reflected from a piece of mother-of-pearl, and still more strikingly
exhibited in the rainbow, produced by raindrops which break up the
sunlight into its component colors and arrange them each in its
appropriate place. Any of these natural methods of decomposing light
might be employed in the construction of a spectroscope, but in
spectroscopes which are used for analyzing the light from feeble
sources, such as a star, or a candle flame, a glass prism of triangular
cross section is usually employed to resolve the light into its
component colors, which it does by refracting it as shown at the edges
of the lens in Fig. 38.

[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Resolution of light into its component colors.]

The course of a beam of light in passing through such a prism is shown
in Fig. 45. Note that the bending of the light from its original course
into a new one, which is here shown as produced by the prism, is quite
similar to the bending shown at the edges of a lens and comes from the
same cause, the slower velocity of light in glass than in air. It takes
the light-waves as long to move over the path _A B_ in glass as over the
longer path _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, of which only the middle section lies in
the glass.

Not only does the prism bend the beam of light transmitted by it, but it
bends in different degree light of different colors, as is shown in the
figure, where the beam at the left of the prism is supposed to be made
up of a mixture of blue and red light, while at the right of the prism
the greater deviation imparted to the blue quite separates the colors,
so that they fall at different places on the screen, _S S_. The compound
light has been analyzed into its constituents, and in the same way every
other color would be put down at its appropriate place on the screen,
and a beam of white light falling upon the prism would be resolved by it
into a sequence of colors, falling upon the screen in the order red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. The initial letters of
these names make the word _Roygbiv_, and by means of it their order is
easily remembered.

[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Principal parts of a spectroscope.]

If the light which is to be examined comes from a star the analysis made
by the prism is complete, and when viewed through a telescope the image
of the star is seen to be drawn out into a band of light, which is
called a _spectrum_, and is red at one end and violet or blue at the
other, with all the colors of the rainbow intervening in proper order
between these extremes. Such a prism placed in front of the objective of
a telescope is called an objective prism, and has been used for stellar
work with marked success at the Harvard College Observatory. But if the
light to be analyzed comes from an object having an appreciable extent
of surface, such as the sun or a planet, the objective prism can not be
successfully employed, since each point of the surface will produce its
own spectrum, and these will appear in the _view telescope_ superposed
and confused one with another in a very objectionable manner. To avoid
this difficulty there is placed between the prism and the source of
light an opaque screen, _S_, with a very narrow slit cut in it, through
which all the light to be analyzed must pass and must also go through a
lens, _A_, placed between the slit and the prism, as shown in Fig. 46.
The slit and lens, together with the tube in which they are usually
supported, are called a _collimator_. By this device a very limited
amount of light is permitted to pass from the object through the slit
and lens to the prism and is there resolved into a spectrum, which is in
effect a series of images of the slit in light of different colors,
placed side by side so close as to make practically a continuous ribbon
of light whose width is the length of each individual picture of the
slit. The length of the ribbon (dispersion) depends mainly upon the
shape of the prism and the kind of glass of which it is made, and it may
be very greatly increased and the efficiency of the spectroscope
enhanced by putting two, three, or more prisms in place of the single
one above described. When the amount of light is very great, as in the
case of the sun or an electric arc lamp, it is advantageous to alter
slightly the arrangement of the spectroscope and to substitute in place
of the prism a grating--i. e., a metallic mirror with a great number of
fine parallel lines ruled upon its surface at equal intervals, one from
another. It is by virtue of such a system of fine parallel grooves that
mother-of-pearl displays its beautiful color effects, and a brilliant
spectrum of great purity and high dispersion is furnished by a grating
ruled with from 10,000 to 20,000 lines to the inch. Fig. 47 represents,
rather crudely, a part of the spectrum of an arc light furnished by such
a grating, or rather it shows three different spectra arranged side by
side, and looking something like a rude ladder. The sides of the ladder
are the spectra furnished by the incandescent carbons of the lamp, and
the cross pieces are the spectrum of the electric arc filling the space
between the carbons. Fig. 48 shows a continuation of the same spectra
into a region where the radiant energy is invisible to the eye, but is
capable of being photographed.

[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Green and blue part of the spectrum of an
electric arc light.]

It is only when a lens is placed between the lamp and the slit of the
spectroscope that the three spectra are shown distinct from each other
as in the figure. The purpose of the lens is to make a picture of the
lamp upon the slit, so that all the radiant energy from any one point of
the arc may be brought to one part of the slit, and thus appear in the
resulting spectrum separated from the energy which comes from every
other part of the arc. Such an instrument is called an _analyzing
spectroscope_ while one without the lens is called an _integrating
spectroscope_, since it furnishes to each point of the slit a sample of
the radiant energy coming from every part of the source of light, and
thus produces only an average spectrum of that source without
distinction of its parts. When a spectroscope is attached to a
telescope, as is often done (see Fig. 49), the eyepiece is removed to
make way for it, and the telescope objective takes the part of the
analyzing lens. A camera is frequently combined with such an apparatus
to photograph the spectra it furnishes, and the whole instrument is then
called a _spectrograph_.

an arc lamp.]

telescope.]

85. SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.--Having seen the mechanism of the spectroscope by
which the light incident upon it is resolved into its constituent parts
and drawn out into a series of colors arranged in the order of their
wave lengths, we have now to consider the interpretation which is to be
placed upon the various kinds of spectra which may be seen, and here we
rely upon the experience of physicists and chemists, from whom we learn
as follows:

The radiant energy which is analyzed by the spectroscope has its source
in the atoms and molecules which make up the luminous body from which
the energy is radiated, and these atoms and molecules are able to
impress upon the ether their own peculiarities in the shape of waves of
different length and amplitude. We have seen that by varying the
conditions of the experiment different kinds of waves may be produced in
a bucket of water; and as a study of these waves might furnish an index
to the conditions which produced them, so the study of the waves
peculiar to the light which comes from any source may be made to give
information about the molecules which make up that source. Thus the
molecules of iron produce a system of waves peculiar to themselves and
which can be duplicated by nothing else, and every other substance gives
off its own peculiar type of energy, presenting a limited and definite
number of wave lengths dependent upon the nature and condition of its
molecules. If these molecules are free to behave in their own
characteristic fashion without disturbance or crowding, they emit light
of these wave lengths only, and we find in the spectrum a series of
bright lines, pictures of the slit produced by light of these particular
wave lengths, while between these bright lines lie dark spaces showing
the absence from the radiant energy of light of intermediate wave
lengths. Such a spectrum is shown in the central portion of Fig. 47,
which, as we have already seen, is produced by the space between the
carbons of the arc lamp. On the other hand, if the molecules are closely
packed together under pressure they so interfere with each other as to
give off a jumble of energy of all wave lengths, and this is translated
by the spectroscope into a continuous ribbon of light with no dark
spaces intervening, as in the upper and lower parts of Figs. 47 and 48,
produced by the incandescent solid carbons of the lamp. These two types
are known as the continuous and discontinuous spectrum, and we may lay
down the following principle regarding them:

A discontinuous spectrum, or bright-line spectrum as it is familiarly
called, indicates that the molecules of the source of light are not
crowded together, and therefore the light must come from an incandescent
gas. A continuous spectrum shows only that the molecules are crowded
together, or are so numerous that the body to which they belong is not
transparent and gives no further information. The body may be solid,
liquid, or gaseous, but in the latter case the gas must be under
considerable pressure or of great extent.

A second principle is: The lines which appear in a spectrum are
characteristic of the source from which the light came--e. g., the
double line in the yellow part of the spectrum at the extreme left in
Fig. 47 is produced by sodium vapor in and around the electric arc and
is never produced by anything but sodium. When by laboratory experiments
we have learned the particular set of lines corresponding to iron, we
may treat the presence of these lines in another spectrum as proof that
iron is present in the source from which the light came, whether that
source be a white-hot poker in the next room or a star immeasurably
distant. The evidence that iron is present lies in the nature of the
light, and there is no reason to suppose that nature to be altered on
the way from star to earth. It may, however, be altered by something
happening to the source from which it comes--e. g., changing temperature
or pressure may affect, and does affect, the spectrum which such a
substance as iron emits, and we must be prepared to find the same
substance presenting different spectra under different conditions, only
these conditions must be greatly altered in order to produce radical
changes in the spectrum.

[Illustration: FIG. 50.--The chief lines in the spectrum of
sunlight.--HERSCHEL.]

86. WAVE LENGTHS.--To identify a line as belonging to and produced by
iron or any other substance, its position in the spectrum--i. e., its
wave length--must be very accurately determined, and for the
identification of a substance by means of its spectrum it is often
necessary to determine accurately the wave lengths of many lines. A
complicated spectrum may consist of hundreds or thousands of lines, due
to the presence of many different substances in the source of light, and
unless great care is taken in assigning the exact position of these
lines in the spectrum, confusion and wrong identifications are sure to
result. For the measurement of the required wave length a tenth meter
(§ 75) is the unit employed, and a scale of wave lengths expressed in
this unit is presented in Fig. 50. The accuracy with which some of these
wave lengths are determined is truly astounding; a ten-billionth of an
inch! These numerical wave lengths save all necessity for referring to
the color of any part of the spectrum, and pictures of spectra for
scientific use are not usually printed in colors.

87. ABSORPTION SPECTRA.--There is another kind of spectrum, of greater
importance than either of those above considered, which is well
illustrated by the spectrum of sunlight (Fig. 50). This is a nearly
continuous spectrum crossed by numerous _dark_ lines due to absorption
of radiant energy in a comparatively cool gas through which it passes on
its way to the spectroscope. Fraunhofer, who made the first careful
study of spectra, designated some of the more conspicuous of these lines
by letters of the alphabet which are shown in the plate, and which are
still in common use as names for the lines, not only in the spectrum of
sunlight but wherever they occur in other spectra. Thus the double line
marked _D_, wave length 5893, falls at precisely the same place in the
spectrum as does the double (sodium) line which we have already seen in
the yellow part of the arc-light spectrum, which line is also called _D_
and bears a very intimate relation to the dark _D_ line of the solar
spectrum.

The student who has access to colored crayons should color one edge of
Fig. 50 in accordance with the lettering there given and, so far as
possible, he should make the transition from one color to the next a
gradual one, as it is in the rainbow.

Fig. 50 is far from being a complete representation of the spectrum of
sunlight. Not only does this spectrum extend both to the right and to
the left into regions invisible to the human eye, but within the limits
of the figure, instead of the seventy-five lines there shown, there are
literally thousands upon thousands of lines, of which only the most
conspicuous can be shown in such a cut as this.

The dark lines which appear in the spectrum of sunlight can, under
proper conditions, be made to appear in the spectrum of an arc light,
and Fig. 51 shows a magnified representation of a small part of such a
spectrum adjacent to the _D_ (sodium) lines. Down the middle of each of
these lines runs a black streak whose position (wave length) is
precisely that of the _D_ lines in the spectrum of sunlight, and whose
presence is explained as follows:

The very hot sodium vapor at the center of the arc gives off its
characteristic light, which, shining through the outer and cooler layers
of sodium vapor, is partially absorbed by these, resulting in a fine
dark line corresponding exactly in position and wave length to the
bright lines, and seen against these as a background, since the higher
temperature at the center of the arc tends to broaden the bright lines
and make them diffuse. Similarly the dark lines in the spectrum of the
sun (Fig. 50) point to the existence of a surrounding envelope of
relatively cool gases, which absorb from the sunlight precisely those
kinds of radiant energy which they would themselves emit if
incandescent. The resulting dark lines in the spectrum are to be
interpreted by the same set of principles which we have above applied to
the bright lines of a discontinuous spectrum, and they may be used to
determine the chemical composition of the sun, just as the bright lines
serve to determine the chemical elements present in the electric arc.
With reference to the mode of their formation, bright-line and dark-line
spectra are sometimes called respectively _emission_ and _absorption_
spectra.

[Illustration: FIG. 51.--The lines reversed.]

88. TYPES OF SPECTRUM.--The sun presents by far the most complex
spectrum known, and Fig. 50 shows only a small number of the more
conspicuous lines which appear in it. Spectra of stars, _per contra_,
appear relatively simple, since their feeble light is insufficient to
bring out faint details. In Chapters XIII and XIV there are shown types
of the different kinds of spectra given by starlight, and these are to
be interpreted by the principles above established. Thus the spectrum of
the bright star β Aurigæ shows a continuous spectrum crossed by a few
heavy absorption lines which are known from laboratory experiments to be
produced only by hydrogen. There must therefore be an atmosphere of
relatively cool hydrogen surrounding this star. The spectrum of Pollux
is quite similar to that of the sun and is to be interpreted as showing
a physical condition similar to that of the sun, while the spectrum of α
Herculis is quite different from either of the others. In subsequent
chapters we shall have occasion to consider more fully these different
types of spectrum.

89. THE DOPPLER PRINCIPLE.--This important principle of the spectrum
analysis is most readily appreciated through the following experiment:

Listen to the whistle of a locomotive rapidly approaching, and observe
how the pitch changes and the note becomes more grave as the locomotive
passes by and commences to recede. During the approach of the whistle
each successive sound wave has a shorter distance to travel in coming to
the ear of the listener than had its predecessor, and in consequence the
waves appear to come in quicker succession, producing a higher note with
a correspondingly shorter wave length than would be heard if the same
whistle were blown with the locomotive at rest. On the other hand, the
wave length is increased and the pitch of the note lowered by the
receding motion of the whistle. A similar effect is produced upon the
wave length of light by a rapid change of distance between the source
from which it comes and the instrument which receives it, so that a
diminishing distance diminishes very slightly the wave length of every
line in the spectrum produced by the light, and an increasing distance
increases these wave lengths, and this holds true whether the change of
distance is produced by motion of the source of light or by motion of
the instrument which receives it.

This change of wave length is sometimes described by saying that when a
body is rapidly approaching, the lines of its spectrum are all displaced
toward the violet end of the spectrum, and are correspondingly displaced
toward the red end by a receding motion. The amount of this shifting,
when it can be measured, measures the velocity of the body along the
line of sight, but the observations are exceedingly delicate, and it is
only in recent years that it has been found possible to make them with
precision. For this purpose there is made to pass through the
spectroscope light from an artificial source which contains one or more
chemical elements known to be present in the star which is to be
observed, and the corresponding lines in the spectrum of this light and
in the spectrum of the star are examined to determine whether they
exactly match in position, or show, as they sometimes do, a slight
displacement, as if one spectrum had been slipped past the other. The
difficulty of the observations lies in the extremely small amount of
this slipping, which rarely if ever in the case of a moving star amounts
to one sixth part of the interval between the close parallel lines
marked _D_ in Fig. 50. The spectral lines furnished by the headlight of
a locomotive running at the rate of a hundred miles per hour would be
displaced by this motion less than one six-thousandth part of the space
between the _D_ lines, an amount absolutely imperceptible in the most
powerful spectroscope yet constructed. But many of the celestial bodies
have velocities so much greater than a hundred miles per hour that these
may be detected and measured by means of the Doppler principle.

90. OTHER INSTRUMENTS.--Other instruments of importance to the
astronomer, but of which only casual mention can here be made, are the
meridian-circle; the transit, one form of which is shown in Fig. 52, and
the zenith telescope, which furnish refined methods for making
observations similar in kind to those which the student has already
learned to make with plumb line and protractor; the sextant, which is
pre-eminently the sailor's instrument for finding the latitude and
longitude at sea, by measuring the altitudes of sun and stars above the
sea horizon; the heliometer, which serves for the very accurate
measurement of small angles, such as the angular distance between two
stars not more than one or two degrees apart; and the photometer, which
is used for measuring the amount of light received from the celestial
bodies.

telescope.]




CHAPTER IX

THE MOON


91. RESULTS OF OBSERVATION WITH THE UNAIDED EYE.--The student who has
made the observations of the moon which are indicated in Chapter III has
in hand data from which much may be learned about the earth's satellite.
Perhaps the most striking feature brought out by them is the motion of
the moon among the stars, always from west toward east, accompanied by
that endless series of changes in shape and brightness--new moon, first
quarter, full moon, etc.--whose successive stages we represent by the
words, the phase of the moon. From his own observation the student
should be able to verify, at least approximately, the following
statements, although the degree of numerical precision contained in some
of them can be reached only by more elaborate apparatus and longer study
than he has given to the subject:

A. The phase of the moon depends upon the distance apart of sun and moon
in the sky, new moon coming when they are together, and full moon when
they are as far apart as possible.

[Illustration: THE MOON, ONE DAY AFTER FIRST QUARTER. From a photograph
made at the Paris Observatory.]

B. The moon is essentially a round, dark body, giving off no light of
its own, but shining solely by reflected sunlight. The proof of this is
that whenever we see a part of the moon which is turned away from the
sun it looks dark--e. g., at new moon, sun and moon are in nearly the
same direction from us and we see little or nothing of the moon, since
the side upon which the sun shines is turned away from us. At full moon
the earth is in line between sun and moon, and we see, round and
bright, the face upon which the sun shines. At other phases, such as the
quarters, the moon turns toward the earth a part of its night hemisphere
and a part of its day hemisphere, but in general only that part which
belongs to the day side of the moon is visible and the peculiar curved
line which forms the boundary--the "ragged edge," or _terminator_, as it
is called, is the dividing line between day and night upon the moon.

A partial exception to what precedes is found for a few days after new
moon when the moon and sun are not very far apart in the sky, for then
the whole round disk of the moon may often be seen, a small part of it
brightly illuminated by the sun and the larger part feebly illuminated
by sunlight which fell first upon the earth and was by it reflected back
to the moon, giving the pleasing effect which is sometimes called the
old moon in the new moon's arms. The new moon--i. e., the part illumined
by the sun--usually appears to belong to a sphere of larger radius than
the old moon, but this is purely a trick played by the eyes of the
observer, and the effect disappears altogether in a telescope. Is there
any similar effect in the few days before new moon?

C. The moon makes the circuit of the sky from a given star around to the
same star again in a little more than 27 days (27.32166), but the
interval between successive new moons--i. e., from the sun around to the
sun again--is more than 29 days (29.53059). This last interval, which is
called a lunar month or _synodical_ month, indicates what we have
learned before--that the sun has changed its place among the stars
during the month, so that it takes the moon an extra two days to
overtake him after having made the circuit of the sky, just as it takes
the minute hand of a clock an extra 5 minutes to catch up with the hour
hand after having made a complete circuit of the dial.

D. Wherever the moon may be in the sky, it turns always the same face
toward the earth, as is shown by the fact that the dark markings which
appear on its surface stand always upon (nearly) the same part of its
disk. It does not always turn the same face toward the sun, for the
boundary line between the illumined and unillumined parts of the moon
shifts from one side to the other as the phase changes, dividing at each
moment day from night upon the moon and illustrating by its slow
progress that upon the moon the day and the month are of equal length
(29.5 terrestrial days), instead of being time units of different
lengths as with us.

[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Motion of moon and earth relative to the sun.]

92. THE MOON'S MOTION.--The student should compare the results of his
own observations, as well as the preceding section, with Fig. 53, in
which the lines with dates printed on them are all supposed to radiate
from the sun and to represent the direction from the sun of earth and
moon upon the given dates which are arbitrarily assumed for the sake of
illustration, any other set would do equally well. The black dots, small
and large, represent the moon revolving about the earth, but having the
circular path shown in Fig. 34 (ellipse) transformed by the earth's
forward motion into the peculiar sinuous line here shown. With respect
to both earth and sun, the moon's orbit deviates but little from a
circle, since the sinuous curve of Fig. 53 follows very closely the
earth's orbit around the sun and is almost identical with it. For
clearness of representation the distance between earth and moon in the
figure has been made ten times too great, and to get a proper idea of
the moon's orbit with reference to the sun, we must suppose the moon
moved up toward the earth until its distance from the line of the
earth's orbit is only a tenth part of what it is in the figure. When
this is done, the moon's path becomes almost indistinguishable from that
of the earth, as may be seen in the figure, where the attempt has been
made to show both lines, and it is to be especially noted that this
real orbit of the moon is everywhere concave toward the sun.

The phase presented by the moon at different parts of its path is
indicated by the row of circles at the right, and the student should
show why a new moon is associated with June 30th and a full moon with
July 15th, etc. What was the date of first quarter? Third quarter?

We may find in Fig. 53 another effect of the same kind as that noted
above in C. Between noon, June 30th, and noon, July 3d, the earth makes
upon its axis three complete revolutions with respect to the sun, but
the meridian which points toward the moon at noon on June 30th will not
point toward it at noon on July 3d, since the moon has moved into a new
position and is now 37° away from the meridian. Verify this statement by
measuring, in Fig. 53, with the protractor, the moon's angular distance
from the meridian at noon on July 3d. When will the meridian overtake
the moon?

93. HARVEST MOON.--The interval between two successive transits of the
meridian past the moon is called a lunar day, and the student should
show from the figure that on the average a lunar day is 51 minutes
longer than a solar day--i. e., upon the average each day the moon comes
to the meridian 51 minutes of solar time later than on the day before.
It is also true that on the average the moon rises and sets 51 minutes
later each day than on the day before. But there is a good deal of
irregularity in the retardation of the time of moonrise and moonset,
since the time of rising depends largely upon the particular point of
the horizon at which the moon appears, and between two days this point
may change so much on account of the moon's orbital motion as to make
the retardation considerably greater or less than its average value. In
northern latitudes this effect is particularly marked in the month of
September, when the eastern horizon is nearly parallel with the moon's
apparent path in the sky, and near the time of full moon in that month
the moon rises on several successive nights at nearly the same hour, and
in less degree the same is true for October. This highly convenient
arrangement of moonlight has caused the full moons of these two months
to be christened respectively the Harvest Moon and the Hunter's Moon.

94. SIZE AND MASS OF THE MOON.--It has been shown in Chapter I how the
distance of the moon from the earth may be measured and its diameter
determined by means of angles, and without enlarging upon the details of
these observations, we note as their result that the moon is a globe
2,163 miles in diameter, and distant from the earth on the average about
240,000 miles. But, as we have seen in Chapter VII, this distance
changes to the extent of a few thousand miles, sometimes less, sometimes
greater, mainly on account of the elliptic shape of the moon's orbit
about the earth, but also in part from the disturbing influence of other
bodies, such as the sun, which pull the moon to and fro, backward and
forward, to quite an appreciable extent.

From the known diameter of the moon it is a matter of elementary
geometry to derive in miles the area of its surface and its volume or
solid contents. Leaving this as an exercise for the student, we adopt
the earth as the standard of comparison and find that the diameter of
the moon is rather more than a quarter, 4/15, that of the earth, the
area of its surface is a trifle more than 1/14 that of the earth, and
its volume a little more than 1/49 of the earth's. So much is pure
geometry, but we may combine with it some mechanical principles which
enable us to go a step farther and to "weigh" the moon--i. e., determine
its mass and the average density of the material of which it is made.

We have seen that the moon moves around the sun in a path differing but
little from the smooth curve shown in Fig. 53, with arrows indicating
the direction of motion, and it would follow absolutely such a smooth
path were it not for the attraction of the earth, and in less degree of
some of the other planets, which swing it about first to one side then
to the other. But action and reaction are equal; the moon pulls as
strongly upon the earth as does the earth upon the moon, and if earth
and moon were of equal mass, the deviation of the earth from the smooth
curve in the figure would be just as large as that of the moon. It is
shown in the figure that the moon does displace the earth from this
curve, and we have only to measure the amount of this displacement of
the earth and compare it with the displacement suffered by the moon to
find how much the mass of the one exceeds that of the other. It may be
seen from the figure that at first quarter, about July 7th, the earth is
thrust ahead in the direction of its orbital motion, while at the third
quarter, July 22d, it is pulled back by the action of the moon, and at
all times it is more or less displaced by this action, so that, in order
to be strictly correct, we must amend our former statement about the
moon moving around the earth and make it read, Both earth and moon
revolve around a point on line between their centers. This point is
called their _center of gravity_, and the earth and the moon both move
in ellipses having this center of gravity at their common focus. Compare
this with Kepler's First Law. These ellipses are similarly shaped, but
of very different size, corresponding to Newton's third law of motion
(Chapter IV), so that the action of the earth in causing the small moon
to move around a large orbit is just equal to the reaction of the moon
in causing the larger earth to move in the smaller orbit. This is
equivalent to saying that the dimensions of the two orbits are inversely
proportional to the masses of the earth and the moon.

By observing throughout the month the direction from the earth to the
sun or to a near planet, such as Mars or Venus, astronomers have
determined that the diameter of the ellipse in which the earth moves is
about 5,850 miles, so that the distance of the earth from the center of
gravity is 2,925 miles, and the distance of the moon from it is
240,000-2,925 = 237,075. We may now write in the form of a proportion--

    Mass of earth : Mass of moon :: 237,075 : 2,925,

and find from it that the mass of the earth is 81 times as great as the
mass of the moon--i. e., leaving kind and quality out of account, there
is enough material in the earth to make 81 moons. We may note in this
connection that the diameter of the earth, 7,926 miles, is greater than
the diameter of the monthly orbit in which the moon causes it to move,
and therefore the center of gravity of earth and moon always lies inside
the body of the earth, about 1,000 miles below the surface.

95. DENSITY OF THE MOON.--It is believed that in a general way the moon
is made of much the same kind of material which goes to make up the
earth--metals, minerals, rocks, etc.--and a part of the evidence upon
which this belief is based lies in the density of the moon. By density
of a substance we mean the amount of it which is contained in a given
volume--i. e., the weight of a bushel or a cubic centimeter of the
stuff. The density of chalk is twice as great as the density of water,
because a cubic centimeter of chalk weighs twice as much as an equal
volume of water, and similarly in other cases the density is found by
dividing the mass or weight of the body by the mass or weight of an
equal volume of water.

We know the mass of the earth (§ 45), and knowing the mass of a cubic
foot of water, it is easy, although a trifle tedious, to compute what
would be the mass of a volume of water equal in size to the earth. The
quotient obtained by dividing one of these masses by the other (mass of
earth ÷ mass of water) is the average density of the material composing
the earth, and we find numerically that this is 5.6--i. e., it would
take 5.6 water earths to attract as strongly as does the real one. From
direct experiment we know that the average density of the principal
rocks which make up the crust of the earth is only about half of this,
showing that the deep-lying central parts of the earth are denser than
the surface parts, as we should expect them to be, because they have to
bear the weight of all that lies above them and are compressed by it.

Turning now to the moon, we find in the same way as for the earth that
its average density is 3.4 as great as that of water.

96. FORCE OF GRAVITY UPON THE MOON.--This number, 3.4, compared with the
5.6 which we found for the earth, shows that on the whole the moon is
made of lighter stuff than is the body of the earth, and this again is
much what we should expect to find, for weight, the force which tends to
compress the substance of the moon, is less there than here. The weight
of a cubic yard of rock at the surface of either earth or moon is the
force with which the earth or moon attracts it, and this by the law of
gravitation is for the earth--

    W = k × (m m´) / (3963)^{2};

and for the moon--

    w = k × {m (m´/81)} / (1081)^{2};

from which we find by division--

    w = (W / 81) (3963 / 1081)^{2} = (W / 6) (approximately).

The cubic yard of rock, which upon the earth weighs two tons, would, if
transported to the moon, weigh only one third of a ton, and would have
only one sixth as much influence in compressing the rocks below it as it
had upon the earth. Note that this rock when transported to the moon
would be still attracted by the earth and would have weight toward the
earth, but it is not this of which we are speaking; by its weight in
the moon we mean the force with which the moon attracts it. Making due
allowance for the difference in compression produced by weight, we may
say that in general, so far as density goes, the moon is very like a
piece of the earth of equal mass set off by itself alone.

97. ALBEDO.--In another respect the lunar stuff is like that of which
the earth is made: it reflects the sunlight in much the same way and to
the same amount. The contrast of light and dark areas on the moon's
surface shows, as we shall see in another section, the presence of
different substances upon the moon which reflect the sunlight in
different degrees. This capacity for reflecting a greater or less
percentage of the incident sunlight is called _albedo_ (Latin,
whiteness), and the brilliancy of the full moon might lead one to
suppose that its albedo is very great, like that of snow or those masses
of summer cloud which we call thunderheads. But this is only an effect
of contrast with the dark background of the sky. The same moon by day
looks pale, and its albedo is, in fact, not very different from that of
our common rocks--weather-beaten sandstone according to Sir John
Herschel--so that it would be possible to build an artificial moon of
rock or brick which would shine in the sunlight much as does the real
moon.

The effect produced by the differences of albedo upon the moon's face is
commonly called the "man in the moon," but, like the images presented by
glowing coals, the face in the moon is anything which we choose to make
it. Among the Chinese it is said to be a monkey pounding rice; in India,
a rabbit; in Persia, the earth reflected as in a mirror, etc.

98. LIBRATIONS.--We have already learned that the moon turns always the
same face toward the earth, and we have now to modify this statement and
to find that here, as in so many other cases, the thing we learn first
is only approximately true and needs to be limited or added to or
modified in some way. In general, Nature is too complex to be completely
understood at first sight or to be perfectly represented by a simple
statement. In Fig. 55 we have two photographs of the moon, taken nearly
three years apart, the right-hand one a little after first quarter and
the left-hand one a little before third quarter. They therefore
represent different parts of the moon's surface, but along the ragged
edge the same region is shown on both photographs, and features common
to both pictures may readily be found--e. g., the three rings which form
a right-angled triangle about one third of the way down from the top of
the cut, and the curved mountain chain just below these. If the moon
turned exactly the same face toward us in the two pictures, the distance
of any one of these markings from any part of the moon's edge must be
the same in both pictures; but careful measurement will show that this
is not the case, and that in the left-hand picture the upper edge of the
moon is tipped toward us and the lower edge away from us, as if the
whole moon had been rotated slightly about a horizontal line and must be
turned back a little (about 7°) in order to match perfectly the other
part of the picture.

This turning is called a _libration_, and it should be borne in mind
that the moon librates not only in the direction above measured, north
and south, but also at right angles to this, east and west, so that we
are able to see a little farther around every part of the moon's edge
than would be possible if it turned toward us at all times exactly the
same face. But in spite of the librations there remains on the farther
side of the moon an area of 6,000,000 square miles which is forever
hidden from us, and of whose character we have no direct knowledge,
although there is no reason to suppose it very different from that which
is visible, despite the fact that some of the books contain quaint
speculations to the contrary. The continent of South America is just
about equal in extent to this unknown region, while North America is a
fair equivalent for all the rest of the moon's surface, both those
central parts which are constantly visible, and the zone around the edge
whose parts sometimes come into sight and are sometimes hidden.

An interesting consequence of the peculiar rotation of the moon is that
from our side of it the earth is always visible. Sun, stars, and planets
rise and set there as well as here, but to an observer on the moon the
earth swings always overhead, shifting its position a few degrees one
way or the other on account of the libration but running through its
succession of phases, new earth, first quarter, etc., without ever going
below the horizon, provided the observer is anywhere near the center of
the moon's disk.

[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Illustrating the moon's rotation.]

99. CAUSE OF LIBRATIONS.--That the moon should librate is by no means so
remarkable a fact as that it should at all times turn very nearly the
same face toward the earth. This latter fact can have but one meaning:
the moon revolves about an axis as does the earth, but the time required
for this revolution is just equal to the time required to make a
revolution in its orbit. Place two coins upon a table with their heads
turned toward the north, as in Fig. 54, and move the smaller one around
the larger in such a way that its face shall always look away from the
larger one. In making one revolution in its orbit the head on this small
coin will be successively directed toward every point of the compass,
and when it returns to its initial position the small coin will have
made just one revolution about an axis perpendicular to the plane of its
orbit. In no other way can it be made to face always away from the
figure at the center of its orbit while moving around it.

We are now in a position to understand the moon's librations, for, if
the small coin at any time moves faster or slower in its orbit than it
turns about its axis, a new side will be turned toward the center, and
the same may happen if the central coin itself shifts into a new
position. This is what happens to the moon, for its orbital motion, like
that of Mercury (Fig. 17), is alternately fast and slow, and in addition
to this there are present other minor influences, such as the fact that
its rotation axis is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of its
orbit; in addition to this the observer upon the earth is daily carried
by its rotation from one point of view to another, etc., so that it is
only in a general way that the rotation upon the axis and motion in the
orbit keep pace with each other. In a general way a cable keeps a ship
anchored in the same place, although wind and waves may cause it to
"librate" about the anchor.

How the moon came to have this exact equality between its times of
revolution and rotation constitutes a chapter of its history upon which
we shall not now enter; but the equality having once been established,
the mechanism by which it is preserved is simple enough.

The attraction of the earth for the moon has very slightly pulled the
latter out of shape (§ 42), so that the particular diameter, which
points toward the earth, is a little longer than any other, and thus
serves as a handle which the earth lays hold of and pulls down into its
lowest possible position--i. e., the position in which it points toward
the center of the earth. Just how long this handle is, remains unknown,
but it may be shown from the law of gravitation that less than a hundred
yards of elongation would suffice for the work it has to do.

100. THE MOON AS A WORLD.--Thus far we have considered the moon as a
satellite of the earth, dependent upon the earth, and interesting
chiefly because of its relation to it. But the moon is something more
than this; it is a world in itself, very different from the earth,
although not wholly unlike it. The most characteristic feature of the
earth's surface is its division into land and water, and nothing of this
kind can be found upon the moon. It is true that the first generation of
astronomers who studied the moon with telescopes fancied that the large
dark patches shown in Fig. 55 were bodies of water, and named them
oceans, seas, lakes, and ponds, and to the present day we keep those
names, although it is long since recognized that these parts of the
moon's surface are as dry as any other. Their dark appearance indicates
a different kind of material from that composing the lighter parts of
the moon, material with a different albedo, just as upon the earth we
have light-colored and dark-colored rocks, marble and slate, which seen
from the moon must present similar contrasts of brightness. Although
these dark patches are almost the only features distinguishable with the
unaided eye, it is far otherwise in the telescope or the photograph,
especially along the ragged edge where great numbers of rings can be
seen, which are apparently depressions in the moon and are called
craters. These we find in great number all over the moon, but, as the
figure shows, they are seen to the best advantage near the
_terminator_--i. e., the dividing line between day and night, since the
long shadows cast here by the rising or setting sun bring out the
details of the surface better than elsewhere. Carefully examine Fig. 55
with reference to these features.

[Illustration: FIG. 55.--The moon at first and last quarter. Lick
Observatory photographs.]

Another feature which exists upon both earth and moon, although far less
common there than here, is illustrated in the chain of mountains visible
near the terminator, a little above the center of the moon in both parts
of Fig. 55. This particular range of mountains, which is called the
Lunar Apennines, is by far the most prominent one upon the moon,
although others, the Alps and Caucasus, exist. But for the most part the
lunar mountains stand alone, each by itself, instead of being grouped
into ranges, as on the earth. Note in the figure that some of the lunar
mountains stretch out into the night side of the moon, their peaks
projecting up into the sunlight, and thus becoming visible, while the
lowlands are buried in the shadow.

A subordinate feature of the moon's surface is the system of _rays_
which seem to radiate like spokes from some of the larger craters,
extending over hill and valley sometimes for hundreds of miles. A
suggestion of these rays may be seen in Fig. 55, extending from the
great crater Copernicus a little southwest of the end of the Apennines,
but their most perfect development is to be seen at the time of full
moon around the crater Tycho, which lies near the south pole of the
moon. Look for them with an opera glass.

Another and even less conspicuous feature is furnished by the rills,
which, under favorable conditions of illumination, appear like long
cracks on the moon's surface, perhaps analogous to the cañons of our
Western country.

101. THE MAP OF THE MOON.--Fig. 55 furnishes a fairly good map of a
limited portion of the moon near the terminator, but at the edges little
or no detail can be seen. This is always true; the whole of the moon can
not be seen to advantage at any one time, and to remedy this we need to
construct from many photographs or drawings a map which shall represent
the several parts of the moon as they appear at their best. Fig. 56
shows such a map photographed from a relief model of the moon, and
representing the principal features of the lunar surface in a way they
can never be seen simultaneously. Perhaps its most striking feature is
the shape of the craters, which are shown round in the central parts of
the map and oval at the edges, with their long diameters parallel to the
moon's edge. This is, of course, an effect of the curvature of the
moon's surface, for we look very obliquely at the edge portions, and
thus see their formations much foreshortened in the direction of the
moon's radius.

[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Relief map of the moon's surface.--After
NASMYTH and CARPENTER.]

The north and south poles of the moon are at the top and bottom of the
map respectively, and a mere inspection of the regions around them will
show how much more rugged is the southern hemisphere of the moon than
the northern. It furnishes, too, some indication of how numerous are the
lunar craters, and how in crowded regions they overlap one another.

The student should pick out upon the map those features which he has
learned to know in the photograph (Fig. 55)--the Apennines, Copernicus,
and the continuation of the Apennines, extending into the dark part of
the moon.

[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Mare Imbrium. Photographed by G. W. RITCHEY.]

102. SIZE OF THE LUNAR FEATURES.--We may measure distances here in the
same way as upon a terrestrial map, remembering that near the edges the
scale of the map is very much distorted parallel to the moon's diameter,
and measurements must not be taken in this direction, but may be taken
parallel to the edge. Measuring with a millimeter scale, we find on the
map for the diameter of the crater Copernicus, 2.1 millimeters. To turn
this into the diameter of the real Copernicus in miles, we measure upon
the same map the diameter of the moon, 79.7 millimeters, and then have
the proportion--

    Diameter of Copernicus in miles : 2,163 :: 2.1 : 79.7,

which when solved gives 57 miles. The real diameter of Copernicus is a
trifle over 56 miles. At the eastern edge of the moon, opposite the
Apennines, is a large oval spot called the Mare Crisium (Latin, _ma-re_
= sea). Measure its length. The large crater to the northwest of the
Apennines is called Archimedes. Measure its diameter both in the map and
in the photograph (Fig. 55), and see how the two results agree. The true
diameter of this crater, east and west, is very approximately 50 miles.
The great smooth surface to the west of Archimedes is the Mare Imbrium.
Is it larger or smaller than Lake Superior? Fig. 57 is from a photograph
of the Mare Imbrium, and the amount of detail here shown at the bottom
of the sea is a sufficient indication that, in this case at least, the
water has been drawn off, if indeed any was ever present.

[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Mare Crisium. Lick Observatory photographs.]

Fig. 58 is a representation of the Mare Crisium at a time when night was
beginning to encroach upon its eastern border, and it serves well to
show the rugged character of the ring-shaped wall which incloses this
area.

With these pictures of the smoother parts of the moon's surface we may
compare Fig. 59, which shows a region near the north pole of the moon,
and Fig. 60, giving an early morning view of Archimedes and the
Apennines. Note how long and sharp are the shadows.

[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Illustrating the rugged character of the moon's
surface.--NASMYTH and CARPENTER.]

103. THE MOON'S ATMOSPHERE.--Upon the earth the sun casts no shadows so
sharp and black as those of Fig. 60, because his rays are here scattered
and reflected in all directions by the dust and vapors of the
atmosphere (§ 51), so that the place from which direct sunlight is cut
off is at least partially illumined by this reflected light. The shadows
of Fig. 60 show that upon the moon it must be otherwise, and suggest
that if the moon has any atmosphere whatever, its density must be
utterly insignificant in comparison with that of the earth. In its
motion around the earth the moon frequently eclipses stars (_occults_ is
the technical word), and if the moon had an atmosphere such as is shown
in Fig. 61, the light from the star _A_ must shine through this
atmosphere just before the moon's advancing body cuts it off, and it
must be refracted by the atmosphere so that the star would appear in a
slightly different direction (nearer to _B_) than before. The earth's
atmosphere refracts the starlight under such circumstances by more than
a degree, but no one has been able to find in the case of the moon any
effect of this kind amounting to even a fraction of a second of arc.
While this hardly justifies the statement sometimes made that the moon
has no atmosphere, we shall be entirely safe in saying that if it has
one at all its density is less than a thousandth part of that of the
earth's atmosphere. Quite in keeping with this absence of an atmosphere
is the fact that clouds never float over the surface of the moon. Its
features always stand out hard and clear, without any of that haze and
softness of outline which our atmosphere introduces into all terrestrial
landscapes.

[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Archimedes and Apennines. NASMYTH and
CARPENTER.]

104. HEIGHT OF THE LUNAR MOUNTAINS.--Attention has already been called
to the detached mountain peaks, which in Fig. 55 prolong the range of
Apennines into the lunar night. These are the beginnings of the Caucasus
mountains, and from the photograph we may measure as follows the height
to which they rise above the surrounding level of the moon: Fig. 62
represents a part of the lunar surface along the boundary line between
night and day, the horizontal line at the top of the figure representing
a level ray of sunlight which just touches the moon at _T_ and barely
illuminates the top of the mountain, _M_, whose height, _h_, is to be
determined. If we let _R_ stand for the radius of the moon and _s_ for
the distance, _T M_, we shall have in the right-angled triangle _M T C_,

    R^{2} + s^{2} = (R + h)^{2},

and we need only to measure _s_--that is, the distance from the
terminator to the detached mountain peak--to make this equation
determine _h_, since _R_ is already known, being half the diameter of
the moon--1,081 miles. Practically it is more convenient to use instead
of this equation another form, which the student who is expert in
algebra may show to be very nearly equivalent to it:

        _h_ (miles) = s^{2} / 2163,
    or  _h_ (feet) = 2.44 s^{2}.

The distance _s_ must be expressed in miles in all of these equations.
In Fig. 55 the distance from the terminator to the first detached peak
of the Caucasus mountains is 1.7 millimeters = 52 miles, from which we
find the height of the mountain to be 1.25 miles, or 6,600 feet.

[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Occultations and the moon's atmosphere.]

[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Determining the height of a lunar mountain.]

Two things, however, need to be borne in mind in this connection. On the
earth we measure the heights of mountains _above sea level_, while on
the moon there is no sea, and our 6,600 feet is simply the height of the
mountain top above the level of that particular point in the terminator,
from which we measure its distance. So too it is evident from the
appearance of things, that the sunlight, instead of just touching the
top of the particular mountain whose height we have measured, really
extends some little distance down from its summit, and the 6,600 feet is
therefore the elevation of the lowest point on the mountains to which
the sunlight reaches. The peak itself may be several hundred feet
higher, and our photograph must be taken at the exact moment when this
peak appears in the lunar morning or disappears in the evening if we are
to measure the altitude of the mountain's summit. Measure the height of
the most northern visible mountain of the Caucasus range. This is one of
the outlying spurs of the great mountain Calippus, whose principal peak,
19,000 feet high, is shown in Fig. 55 as the brightest part of the
Caucasus range.

The highest peak of the lunar Apennines, Huyghens, has an altitude of
18,000 feet, and the Leibnitz and Doerfel Mountains, near the south pole
of the moon, reach an altitude 50 per cent greater than this, and are
probably the highest peaks on the moon. This falls very little short of
the highest mountain on the earth, although the moon is much smaller
than the earth, and these mountains are considerably higher than
anything on the western continent of the earth.

The vagueness of outline of the terminator makes it difficult to measure
from it with precision, and somewhat more accurate determinations of the
heights of lunar mountains can be obtained by measuring the length of
the shadows which they cast, and the depths of craters may also be
measured by means of the shadows which fall into them.

105. CRATERS.--Fig. 63 shows a typical lunar crater, and conveys a good
idea of the ruggedness of the lunar landscape. Compare the appearance of
this crater with the following generalizations, which are based upon the
accurate measurement of many such:

A. A crater is a real depression in the surface of the moon, surrounded
usually by an elevated ring which rises above the general level of the
region outside, while the bottom of the crater is about an equal
distance below that level.

B. Craters are shallow, their diameters ranging from five times to more
than fifty times their depth. Archimedes, whose diameter we found to be
50 miles, has an average depth of about 4,000 feet below the crest of
its surrounding wall, and is relatively a shallow crater.

[Illustration: FIG. 63.--A typical lunar crater.--NASMYTH and
CARPENTER.]

C. Craters frequently have one or more hills rising within them which,
however, rarely, if ever, reach up to the level of the surrounding wall.

D. Whatever may have been the mode of their formation, the craters can
not have been produced by scooping out material from the center and
piling it up to make the wall, for in three cases out of four the volume
of the excavation is greater than the volume of material contained in
the wall.

106. MOON AND EARTH.--We have gone far enough now to appreciate both the
likeness and the unlikeness of the moon and earth. They may fairly
enough be likened to offspring of the same parent who have followed very
different careers, and in the fullness of time find themselves in very
different circumstances. The most serious point of difference in these
circumstances is the atmosphere, which gives to the earth a wealth of
phenomena altogether lacking in the moon. Clouds, wind, rain, snow,
dew, frost, and hail are all dependent upon the atmosphere and can not
be found where it is not. There can be nothing upon the moon at all like
that great group of changes which we call weather, and the unruffled
aspect of the moon's face contrasts sharply with the succession of cloud
and sunshine which the earth would present if seen from the moon.

The atmosphere is the chief agent in the propagation of sound, and
without it the moon must be wrapped in silence more absolute than can be
found upon the surface of the earth. So, too, the absence of an
atmosphere shows that there can be no water or other liquid upon the
moon, for if so it would immediately evaporate and produce a gaseous
envelope which we have seen does not exist. With air and water absent
there can be of course no vegetation or life of any kind upon the moon,
and we are compelled to regard it as an arid desert, utterly waste.

107. TEMPERATURE OF THE MOON.--A characteristic feature of terrestrial
deserts, which is possessed in exaggerated degree by the moon, is the
great extremes of temperature to which they and it are subject. Owing to
its slow rotation about its axis, a point on the moon receives the solar
radiation uninterruptedly for more than a fortnight, and that too
unmitigated by any cloud or vaporous covering. Then for a like period it
is turned away from the sun and allowed to cool off, radiating into
interplanetary space without hindrance its accumulated store of heat. It
is easy to see that the range of temperature between day and night must
be much greater under these circumstances than it is with us where
shorter days and clouded skies render day and night more nearly alike,
to say nothing of the ocean whose waters serve as a great balance wheel
for equalizing temperatures. Just how hot or how cold the moon becomes
is hard to determine, and very different estimates are to be found in
the books. Perhaps the most reliable of these are furnished by the
recent researches of Professor Very, whose experiments lead him to
conclude that "its rocky surface at midday, in latitudes where the sun
is high, is probably hotter than boiling water and only the most
terrible of earth's deserts, where the burning sands blister the skin,
and men, beasts, and birds drop dead, can approach a noontide on the
cloudless surface of our satellite. Only the extreme polar latitudes of
the moon can have an endurable temperature by day, to say nothing of the
night, when we should have to become troglodytes to preserve ourselves
from such intense cold."

While the night temperature of the moon, even very soon after sunset,
sinks to something like 200° below zero on the centigrade scale, or 320°
below zero on the Fahrenheit scale, the lowest known temperature upon
the earth, according to General Greely, is 90° Fahr. below zero,
recorded in Siberia in January, 1885.

Winter and summer are not markedly different upon the moon, since its
rotation axis is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit
about the sun, and the sun never goes far north or south of the moon's
equator. The month is the one cycle within which all seasonal changes in
its physical condition appear to run their complete course.

108. CHANGES IN THE MOON.--It is evidently idle to look for any such
changes in the condition of the moon's surface as with us mark the
progress of the seasons or the spread of civilization over the
wilderness. But minor changes there may be, and it would seem that the
violent oscillations of temperature from day to night ought to have some
effect in breaking down and crumbling the sharp peaks and crags which
are there so common and so pronounced. For a century past astronomers
have searched carefully for changes of this kind--the filling up of some
crater or the fall of a mountain peak; but while some things of this
kind have been reported from time to time, the evidence in their behalf
has not been altogether conclusive. At the present time it is an open
question whether changes of this sort large enough to be seen from the
earth are in progress. A crater much less than a mile wide can be seen
in the telescope, but it is not easy to tell whether so minute an object
has changed in size or shape during a year or a decade, and even if
changes are seen they may be apparent rather than real. Fig. 64 contains
two views of the crater Archimedes, taken under a morning and an
afternoon sun respectively, and shows a very pronounced difference
between the two which proceeds solely from a difference of illumination.
In the presence of such large fictitious changes astronomers are slow to
accept smaller ones as real.

[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Archimedes in the lunar morning and
afternoon.--WEINEK.]

It is this absence of change that is responsible for the rugged and
sharp-cut features of the moon which continue substantially as they were
made, while upon the earth rain and frost are continually wearing down
the mountains and spreading their substance upon the lowland in an
unending process of smoothing off the roughnesses of its surface. Upon
the moon this process is almost if not wholly wanting, and the moon
abides to-day much more like its primitive condition than is the earth.

109. THE MOON'S INFLUENCE UPON THE EARTH.--There is a widespread popular
belief that in many ways the moon exercises a considerable influence
upon terrestrial affairs: that it affects the weather for good or ill,
that crops must be planted and harvested, pigs must be killed, and
timber cut at the right time of the moon, etc. Our common word lunatic
means moonstruck--i. e., one upon whom the moon has shone while
sleeping. There is not the slightest scientific basis for any of these
beliefs, and astronomers everywhere class them with tales of witchcraft,
magic, and popular delusion. For the most part the moon's influence upon
the earth is limited to the light which it sends and the effect of its
gravitation, chiefly exhibited in the ocean tides. We receive from the
moon a very small amount of second-hand solar heat and there is also a
trifling magnetic influence, but neither of these last effects comes
within the range of ordinary observation, and we shall not go far wrong
in saying that, save the moonlight and the tides, every supposed lunar
influence upon the earth is either fictitious or too small to be readily
detected.




CHAPTER X

THE SUN


110. DEPENDENCE OF THE EARTH UPON THE SUN.--There is no better
introduction to the study of the sun than Byron's Ode to Darkness,
beginning with the lines--

    "I dreamed a dream
    That was not all a dream.
    The bright sun was extinguished,"

and proceeding to depict in vivid words the consequences of this
extinction. The most matter-of-fact language of science agrees with the
words of the poet in declaring the earth's dependence upon the sun for
all those varied forms of energy which make it a fit abode for living
beings. The winds blow and the rivers run; the crops grow, are gathered
and consumed, by virtue of the solar energy. Factory, locomotive, beast,
bird, and the human body furnish types of machines run by energy derived
from the sun; and the student will find it an instructive exercise to
search for kinds of terrestrial energy which are not derived either
directly or indirectly from the sun. There are a few such, but they are
neither numerous nor important.

111. THE SUN'S DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH.--To the astronomer the sun
presents problems of the highest consequence and apparently of very
diverse character, but all tending toward the same goal: the framing of
a mechanical explanation of the sun considered as a machine; what it is,
and how it does its work. In the forefront of these problems stand those
numerical determinations of distance, size, mass, density, etc., which
we have already encountered in connection with the moon, but which must
here be dealt with in a different manner, because the immensely greater
distance of the sun makes impossible the resort to any such simple
method as the triangle used for determining the moon's distance. It
would be like determining the distance of a steeple a mile away by
observing its direction first from one eye, then from the other; too
short a base for the triangle. In one respect, however, we stand upon a
better footing than in the case of the moon, for the mass of the earth
has already been found (Chapter IV) as a fractional part of the sun's
mass, and we have only to invert the fraction in order to find that the
sun's mass is 329,000 times that of the earth and moon combined, or
333,000 times that of the earth alone.

If we could rely implicitly upon this number we might make it determine
for us the distance of the sun through the law of gravitation as
follows: It was suggested in § 38 that Newton proved Kepler's three laws
to be imperfect corollaries from the law of gravitation, requiring a
little amendment to make them strictly correct, and below we give in the
form of an equation Kepler's statement of the Third Law together with
Newton's amendment of it. In these equations--

_T_ = Periodic time of any planet;

_a_ = One half the major axis of its orbit;

_m_ = Its mass;

_M_ = The mass of the sun;

_k_ = The gravitation constant corresponding to the particular set of
units in which _T_, _a_, _m_, and _M_ are expressed.

  (Kepler) a^{3}/T^{2} = h;
  (Newton) a^{3}/T^{2} = k (M + m).

Kepler's idea was: For every planet which moves around the sun, _a^{3}_
divided by _T^{2}_ always gives the same quotient, _h_; and he did not
concern himself with the significance of this quotient further than to
note that if the particular _a_ and _T_ which belong to any
planet--e. g., the earth--be taken as the units of length and time, then
the quotient will be 1. Newton, on the other hand, attached a meaning to
the quotient, and showed that it is equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the sum of the two masses, planet and sun, by a number which
is always the same when we are dealing with the action of gravitation,
whether it be between the sun and planet, or between moon and earth, or
between the earth and a roast of beef in the butcher's scales, provided
only that we use always the same units with which to measure times,
distances, and masses.

Numerically, Newton's correction to Kepler's Third Law does not amount
to much in the motion of the planets. Jupiter, which shows the greatest
effect, makes the circuit of his orbit in 4,333 days instead of 4,335,
which it would require if Kepler's law were strictly true. But in
another respect the change is of the utmost importance, since it enables
us to extend Kepler's law, which relates solely to the sun and its
planets, to other attracting bodies, such as the earth, moon, and stars.
Thus for the moon's motion around the earth we write--

    (240,000^{3})/(27.32^{2}) = k (1 + 1/81),

from which we may find that, with the units here employed, the earth's
mass as the unit of mass, the mean solar day as the unit of time, and
the mile as the unit of distance--

    k = 1830 × 10^{10}.

If we introduce this value of _k_ into the corresponding equation, which
represents the motion of the earth around the sun, we shall have--

    a^{3}/(365.25)^{2} = 1830 × 10^{10} (333,000 + 1),

where the large number in the parenthesis represents the number of times
the mass of the sun is greater than the mass of the earth. We shall find
by solving this equation that _a_, the mean distance of the sun from the
earth, is very approximately 93,000,000 miles.

113. ANOTHER METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SUN'S DISTANCE.--This will be
best appreciated by a reference to Fig. 17. It appears here that the
earth makes its nearest approach to the orbit of Mars in the month of
August, and if in any August Mars happens to be in opposition, its
distance from the earth will be very much less than the distance of the
sun from the earth, and may be measured by methods not unlike those
which served for the moon. If now the orbits of Mars and the earth were
circles having their centers at the sun this distance between them,
which we may represent by _D_, would be the difference of the radii of
these orbits--

    D = a´´ - a´,

where the accents ´´, ´ represent Mars and the earth respectively.
Kepler's Third Law furnishes the relation--

    (a´´)^{3}/(T´´)^{2} = (a´)^{3}/(T´)^{2};

and since the periodic times of the earth and Mars, _T´_, _T´´_, are
known to a high degree of accuracy, these two equations are sufficient
to determine the two unknown quantities, _a´_, _a´´_--i. e., the
distance of the sun from Mars as well as from the earth. The first of
these equations is, of course, not strictly true, on account of the
elliptical shape of the orbits, but this can be allowed for easily
enough.

In practice it is found better to apply this method of determining the
sun's distance through observations of an asteroid rather than
observations of Mars, and great interest has been aroused among
astronomers by the discovery, in 1898, of an asteroid, or planet, Eros,
which at times comes much closer to the earth than does Mars or any
other heavenly body except the moon, and which will at future
oppositions furnish a more accurate determination of the sun's distance
than any hitherto available. Observations for this purpose are being
made at the present time (October, 1900).

Many other methods of measuring the sun's distance have been devised by
astronomers, some of them extremely ingenious and interesting, but every
one of them has its weak point--e. g., the determination of the mass of
the earth in the first method given above and the measurement of _D_ in
the second method, so that even the best results at present are
uncertain to the extent of 200,000 miles or more, and astronomers,
instead of relying upon any one method, must use all of them, and take
an average of their results. According to Professor Harkness, this
average value is 92,796,950 miles, and it seems certain that a line of
this length drawn from the earth toward the sun would end somewhere
within the body of the sun, but whether on the nearer or the farther
side of the center, or exactly at it, no man knows.

114. PARALLAX AND DISTANCE.--It is quite customary among astronomers to
speak of the sun's parallax, instead of its distance from the earth,
meaning by parallax its difference of direction as seen from the center
and surface of the earth--i. e., the angle subtended at the sun by a
radius of the earth placed at right angles to the line of sight. The
greater the sun's distance the smaller will this angle be, and it
therefore makes a substitute for the distance which has the advantage of
being represented by a small number, 8".8, instead of a large one.

The books abound with illustrations intended to help the reader
comprehend how great is a distance of 93,000,000 miles, but a single one
of these must suffice here. To ride 100 miles a day 365 days in the year
would be counted a good bicycling record, but the rider who started at
the beginning of the Christian era and rode at that rate toward the sun
from the year 1 A. D. down to the present moment would not yet have
reached his destination, although his journey would be about three
quarters done. He would have crossed the orbit of Venus about the time
of Charlemagne, and that of Mercury soon after the discovery of America.

115. SIZE AND DENSITY OF THE SUN.--Knowing the distance of the sun, it
is easy to find from the angle subtended by its diameter (32 minutes of
arc) that the length of that diameter is 865,000 miles. We recall in
this connection that the diameter of the moon's _orbit_ is only 480,000
miles, but little more than half the diameter of the sun, thus affording
abundant room inside the sun, and to spare, for the moon to perform the
monthly revolution about its orbit, as shown in Fig. 65.

[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The sun's size.--YOUNG.]

In the same manner in which the density of the moon was found from its
mass and diameter, the student may find from the mass and diameter of
the sun given above that its mean density is 1.4 times that of water.
This is about the same as the density of gravel or soft coal, and is
just about one quarter of the average density of the earth.

We recall that the small density of the moon was accounted for by the
diminished weight of objects upon it, but this explanation can not hold
in the case of the sun, for not only is the density less but the force
of gravity (weight) is there 28 times as great as upon the earth. The
athlete who here weighs 175 pounds, if transported to the surface of the
sun would weigh more than an elephant does here, and would find his
bones break under his own weight if his muscles were strong enough to
hold him upright. The tremendous pressure exerted by gravity at the
surface of the sun must be surpassed below the surface, and as it does
not pack the material together and make it dense, we are driven to one
of two conclusions: Either the stuff of which the sun is made is
altogether unlike that of the earth, not so readily compressed by
pressure, or there is some opposing influence at work which more than
balances the effect of gravity and makes the solar stuff much lighter
than the terrestrial.

116. MATERIAL OF WHICH THE SUN IS MADE.--As to the first of these
alternatives, the spectroscope comes to our aid and shows in the sun's
spectrum (Fig. 50) the characteristic line marked _D_, which we know
always indicates the presence of sodium and identifies at least one
terrestrial substance as present in the sun in considerable quantity.
The lines marked _C_ and _F_ are produced by hydrogen, which is one of
the constituents of water, _E_ shows calcium to be present in the sun,
_b_ magnesium, etc. In this way it has been shown that about one half of
our terrestrial elements, mainly the metallic ones, are present as gases
on or near the sun's surface, but it must not be inferred that elements
not found in this way are absent from the sun. They may be there,
probably are there, but the spectroscopic proof of their presence is
more difficult to obtain. Professor Rowland, who has been prominent in
the study of the solar spectrum, says: "Were the whole earth heated to
the temperature of the sun, its spectrum would probably resemble that of
the sun very closely."

Some of the common terrestrial elements found in the sun are:

      Aluminium.
      Calcium.
      Carbon.
      Copper.
      Hydrogen.
      Iron.
      Lead.
      Nickel.
      Potassium.
      Silicon.
      Silver.
      Sodium.
      Tin.
      Zinc.
      Oxygen (?)

Whatever differences of chemical structure may exist between the sun and
the earth, it seems that we must regard these bodies as more like than
unlike to each other in substance, and we are brought back to the second
of our alternatives: there must be some influence opposing the force of
gravity and making the substance of the sun light instead of heavy, and
we need not seek far to find it in--

117. THE HEAT OF THE SUN.--That the sun is hot is too evident to require
proof, and it is a familiar fact that heat expands most substances and
makes them less dense. The sun's heat falling upon the earth expands it
and diminishes its density in some small degree, and we have only to
imagine this process of expansion continued until the earth's diameter
becomes 58 per cent larger than it now is, to find the earth's density
reduced to a level with that of the sun. Just how much the temperature
of the earth must be raised to produce this amount of expansion we do
not know, neither do we know accurately the temperature of the sun, but
there can be no doubt that heat is the cause of the sun's low density
and that the corresponding temperature is very high.

Before we inquire more closely into the sun's temperature, it will be
well to draw a sharp distinction between the two terms heat and
temperature, which are often used as if they meant the same thing. Heat
is a form of energy which may be found in varying degree in every
substance, whether warm or cold--a block of ice contains a considerable
amount of heat--while temperature corresponds to our sensations of warm
and cold, and measures the extent to which heat is concentrated in the
body. It is the amount of heat per molecule of the body. A barrel of
warm water contains more heat than the flame of a match, but its
temperature is not so high. Bearing in mind this distinction, we seek to
determine not the amount of heat contained in the sun but the sun's
temperature, and this involves the same difficulty as does the question,
What is the temperature of a locomotive? It is one thing in the fire box
and another thing in the driving wheels, and still another at the
headlight; and so with the sun, its temperature is certainly different
in different parts--one thing at the center and another at the surface.
Even those parts which we see are covered by a veil of gases which
produce by absorption the dark lines of the solar spectrum, and
seriously interfere both with the emission of energy from the sun and
with our attempts at measuring the temperature of those parts of the
surface from which that energy streams.

In view of these and other difficulties we need not be surprised that
the wildest discordance has been found in estimates of the solar
temperature made by different investigators, who have assigned to it
values ranging from 1,400° C. to more than 5,000,000° C. Quite recently,
however, improved methods and a better understanding of the problem have
brought about a better agreement of results, and it now seems probable
that the temperature of the visible surface of the sun lies somewhere
between 5,000° and 10,000° C., say 15,000° of the Fahrenheit scale.

118. DETERMINING THE SUN'S TEMPERATURE.--One ingenious method which has
been used for determining this temperature is based upon the principle
stated above, that every object, whether warm or cold, contains heat and
gives it off in the form of radiant energy. The radiation from a body
whose temperature is lower than 500° C. is made up exclusively of energy
whose wave length is greater than 7,600 tenth meters, and is therefore
invisible to the eye, although a thermometer or even the human hand can
often detect it as radiant heat. A brick wall in the summer sunshine
gives off energy which can be felt as heat but can not be seen. When
such a body is further heated it continues to send off the same kinds
(wave lengths) of energy as before, but new and shorter waves are added
to its radiation, and when it begins to emit energy of wave length 7,500
or 7,600 tenth meters, it also begins to shine with a dull-red light,
which presently becomes brighter and less ruddy and changes to white as
the temperature rises, and waves of still shorter length are thereby
added to the radiation. We say, in common speech, the body becomes first
red hot and then white hot, and we thus recognize in a general way that
the kind or color of the radiation which a body gives off is an index to
its temperature. The greater the proportion of energy of short wave
lengths the higher is the temperature of the radiating body. In sunlight
the maximum of brilliancy to the eye lies at or near the wave length,
5,600 tenth meters, but the greatest intensity of radiation of all kinds
(light included) is estimated to fall somewhere between green and blue
in the spectrum at or near the wave length 5,000 tenth meters, and if we
can apply to this wave length Paschen's law--temperature reckoned in
degrees centigrade from the absolute zero is always equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the number 27,000,000 by the wave length
corresponding to maximum radiation--we shall find at once for the
absolute temperature of the sun's surface 5,400° C.

Paschen's law has been shown to hold true, at least approximately, for
lower temperatures and longer wave lengths than are here involved, but
as it is not yet certain that it is strictly true and holds for all
temperatures, too great reliance must not be attached to the numerical
result furnished by it.

Goodsell Observatory.]

[Illustration: FIG. 67.--The sun, August 14, 1894. Photographed at the
Goodsell Observatory.]

119. THE SUN'S SURFACE.--A marked contrast exists between the faces of
sun and moon in respect of the amount of detail to be seen upon them,
the sun showing nothing whatever to correspond with the mountains,
craters, and seas of the moon. The unaided eye in general finds in the
sun only a blank bright circle as smooth and unmarked as the surface of
still water, and even the telescope at first sight seems to show but
little more. There may usually be found upon the sun's face a certain
number of black patches called _sun spots_, such as are shown in Figs.
66 to 69, and occasionally these are large enough to be seen through a
smoked glass without the aid of a telescope. When seen near the edge of
the sun they are quite frequently accompanied, as in Fig. 69, by vague
patches called _faculæ_ (Latin, _facula_ = a little torch), which look a
little brighter than the surrounding parts of the sun. So, too, a good
photograph of the sun usually shows that the central parts of the disk
are rather brighter than the edge, as indeed we should expect them to
be, since the absorption lines in the sun's spectrum have already taught
us that the visible surface of the sun is enveloped by invisible vapors
which in some measure absorb the emitted light and render it feebler at
the edge where it passes through a greater thickness of this envelope
than at the center. See Fig. 70, where it is shown that the energy
coming from the edge of the sun to the earth has to traverse a much
longer path inside the vapors than does that coming from the center.

[Illustration: FIG. 68.--The sun, August 18, 1894. Photographed at the
Goodsell Observatory.]

Examine the sun spots in the four photographs, Figs. 66 to 69, and note
that the two spots which appear at the extreme left of the first
photograph, very much distorted and foreshortened by the curvature of
the sun's surface, are seen in a different part of the second picture,
and are not only more conspicuous but show better their true shape.

[Illustration: PLATE II. THE EQUATORIAL CONSTELLATIONS]

120. THE SUN'S ROTATION.--The changed position of these spots shows that
the sun rotates about an axis at right angles to the direction of the
spot's motion, and the position of this axis is shown in the figure by a
faint line ruled obliquely across the face of the sun nearly north and
south in each of the four photographs. This rotation in the space of
three days has carried the spots from the edge halfway to the center of
the disk, and the student should note the progress of the spots in the
two later photographs, that of August 21st showing them just ready to
disappear around the farther edge of the sun.

[Illustration: FIG. 69.--The sun, August 21, 1894. Photographed at the
Goodsell Observatory.]

Plot accurately in one of these figures the positions of the spots as
shown in the other three, and observe whether the path of the spots
across the sun's face is a straight line. Is there any reason why it
should not be straight?

These four pictures may be made to illustrate many things about the sun.
Thus the sun's axis is not parallel to that of the earth, for the
letters _N S_ mark the direction of a north and south line across the
face of the sun, and this line, of course, is parallel to the earth's
axis, while it is evidently not parallel to the sun's axis. The group of
spots took more than ten days to move across the sun's face, and as at
least an equal time must be required to move around the opposite side of
the sun, it is evident that the period of the sun's rotation is
something more than 20 days. It is, in fact, rather more than 25 days,
for this same group of spots reappeared again on the left-hand edge of
the sun on September 5th.

[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Absorption at the sun's edge.]

121. SUN SPOTS.--Another significant fact comes out plainly from the
photographs. The spots are not permanent features of the sun's face,
since they changed their size and shape very appreciably in the few days
covered by the pictures. Compare particularly the photographs of August
14th and August 18th, where the spots are least distorted by the
curvature of the sun's surface. By September 16th this group of spots
had disappeared absolutely from the sun's face, although when at its
largest the group extended more than 80,000 miles in length, and several
of the individual spots were large enough to contain the earth if it had
been dropped upon them. From Fig. 67 determine in miles the length of
the group on August 14th. Fig. 71 shows an enlarged view of these spots
as they appeared on August 17th, and in this we find some details not so
well shown in the preceding pictures. The larger spots consist of a
black part called the _nucleus_ or _umbra_ (Latin, shadow), which is
surrounded by an irregular border called the _penumbra_ (partial
shadow), which is intermediate in brightness between the nucleus and
the surrounding parts of the sun. It should not be inferred from the
picture that the nucleus is really black or even dark. It shines, in
fact, with a brilliancy greater than that of an electric lamp, but the
background furnished by the sun's surface is so much brighter that by
contrast with it the nucleus and penumbra appear relatively dark.

[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Sun spots, August 17, 1894. Goodsell
Observatory.]

[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Sun spot of March 5, 1873.--From LANGLEY, The
New Astronomy. By permission of the publishers.]

The bright shining surface of the sun, the background for the spots, is
called the _photosphere_ (Greek, light sphere), and, as Fig. 71 shows,
it assumes under a suitable magnifying power a mottled aspect quite
different from the featureless expanse shown in the earlier pictures.
The photosphere is, in fact, a layer of little clouds with darker
spaces between them, and the fine detail of these clouds, their
complicated structure, and the way in which, when projected against the
background of a sun spot, they produce its penumbra, are all brought out
in Fig. 72. Note that the little patch in one corner of this picture
represents North and South America drawn to the same scale as the sun
spots.

[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Spectroheliograph, showing distribution of
faculæ upon the sun.--HALE.]

[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Eclipse of July 20, 1878.--TROUVELOT.]

122. FACULÆ.--We have seen in Fig. 69 a few of the bright spots called
faculæ. At the telescope or in the ordinary photograph these can be seen
only at the edge of the sun, because elsewhere the background furnished
by the photosphere is so bright that they are lost in it. It is
possible, however, by an ingenious application of the spectroscope to
break up the sunlight into a spectrum in such a way as to diminish the
brightness of this background, much more than the brightness of the
faculæ is diminished, and in this way to obtain a photograph of the
sun's surface which shall show them wherever they occur, and such a
photograph, showing faintly the spectral lines, is reproduced in Fig.
73. The faculæ are the bright patches which stretch inconspicuously
across the face of the sun, in two rather irregular belts with a
comparatively empty lane between them. This lane lies along the sun's
equator, and it is upon either side of it between latitudes 5° and 40°
that faculæ seem to be produced. It is significant of their connection
with sun spots that the spots occur in these particular zones and are
rarely found outside them.

[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Eclipse of April 16, 1893.--SCHAEBERLE.]

123. INVISIBLE PARTS OF THE SUN. THE CORONA.--Thus far we have been
dealing with parts of the sun that may be seen and photographed under
all ordinary conditions. But outside of and surrounding these parts is
an envelope, or rather several envelopes, of much greater extent than
the visible sun. These envelopes are for the most part invisible save at
those times when the brighter central portions of the sun are hidden in
a total eclipse.

[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Eclipse of January 21, 1898.--CAMPBELL.]

Fig. 74 is from a drawing, and Figs. 75 and 76 are from eclipse
photographs showing this region, in which the most conspicuous object
is the halo of soft light called the _corona_, that completely surrounds
the sun but is seen to be of differing shapes and differing extent at
the several eclipses here shown, although a large part of these apparent
differences is due to technical difficulties in photographing, and
reproducing an object with outlines so vague as those of the corona. The
outline of the corona is so indefinite and its outer portions so faint
that it is impossible to assign to it precise dimensions, but at its
greatest extent it reaches out for several millions of miles and fills a
space more than twenty times as large as the visible part of the sun.
Despite its huge bulk, it is of most unsubstantial character, an airy
nothing through which comets have been known to force their way around
the sun from one side to the other, literally for millions of miles,
without having their course influenced or their velocity checked to any
appreciable extent. This would hardly be possible if the density even at
the bottom of the corona were greater than that of the best vacuum which
we are able to produce in laboratory experiments. It seems odd that a
vacuum should give off so bright a light as the coronal pictures show,
and the exact character of that light and the nature of the corona are
still subjects of dispute among astronomers, although it is generally
agreed that, in part at least, its light is ordinary sunlight faintly
reflected from the widely scattered molecules composing the substance of
the corona. It is also probable that in part the light has its origin in
the corona itself. A curious and at present unconfirmed result announced
by one of the observers of the eclipse of May 28, 1900, is that _the
corona is not hot_, its effective temperature being lower than that of
the instrument used for the observation.

[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Solar prominence of March 25, 1895.--HALE.]

124. THE CHROMOSPHERE.--Between the corona and the photosphere there is
a thin separating layer called the _chromosphere_ (Greek, color sphere),
because when seen at an eclipse it shines with a brilliant red light
quite unlike anything else upon the sun save the _prominences_ which are
themselves only parts of the chromosphere temporarily thrown above its
surface, as in a fountain a jet of water is thrown up from the basin and
remains for a few moments suspended in mid-air. Not infrequently in such
a fountain foreign matter is swept up by the rush of the water--dirt,
twigs, small fish, etc.--and in like manner the prominences often carry
along with them parts of the underlying layers of the sun, photosphere,
faculæ, etc., which reveal their presence in the prominence by adding
their characteristic lines to the spectrum, like that of the
chromosphere, which the prominence presents when they are absent. None
of the eclipse photographs (Figs. 74 to 76) show the chromosphere,
because the color effect is lacking in them, but a great curving
prominence may be seen near the bottom of Fig. 75, and smaller ones at
other parts of the sun's edge.

[Illustration: FIG. 78.--A solar prominence.--HALE.]

125. PROMINENCES.--Fig. 77 shows upon a larger scale one of these
prominences rising to a height of 160,000 miles above the photosphere;
and another photograph, taken 18 minutes later, but not reproduced here,
showed the same prominence grown in this brief interval to a stature of
280,000 miles. These pictures were not taken during an eclipse, but in
full sunlight, using the same spectroscopic apparatus which was employed
in connection with the faculæ to diminish the brightness of the
background without much enfeebling the brilliancy of the prominence
itself. The dark base from which the prominence seems to spring is not
the sun's edge, but a part of the apparatus used to cut off the direct
sunlight.

Fig. 78 contains a series of photographs of another prominence taken
within an interval of 1 hour 47 minutes and showing changes in size and
shape which are much more nearly typical of the ordinary prominence than
was the very unusual change in the case of Fig. 77.

[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Contrasted forms of solar
prominences.--ZOELLNER.]

The preceding pictures are from photographs, and with them the student
may compare Fig. 79, which is constructed from drawings made at the
spectroscope by the German astronomer Zoellner. The changes here shown
are most marked in the prominence at the left, which is shaped like a
broken tree trunk, and which appears to be vibrating from one side to
the other like a reed shaken in the wind. Such a prominence is
frequently called an _eruptive_ one, a name suggested by its appearance
of having been blown out from the sun by something like an explosion,
while the prominence at the right in this series of drawings, which
appears much less agitated, is called by contrast with the other a
_quiescent_ prominence. These quiescent prominences are, as a rule, much
longer-lived than the eruptive ones. One more picture of prominences
(Fig. 80) is introduced to show the continuous stretch of chromosphere
out of which they spring.

[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Prominences and chromosphere.--HALE.]

Prominences are seen only at the edge of the sun, because it is there
alone that the necessary background can be obtained, but they must occur
at the center of the sun and elsewhere quite as well as at the edge, and
it is probable that quiescent prominences are distributed over all parts
of the sun's surface, but eruptive prominences show a strong tendency
toward the regions of sun spots and faculæ as if all three were
intimately related phenomena.

126. THE SUN AS A MACHINE.--Thus far we have considered the anatomy of
the sun, dissecting it into its several parts, and our next step should
be a consideration of its physiology, the relation of the parts to each
other, and their function in carrying on the work of the solar organism,
but this step, unfortunately, must be a lame one. The science of
astronomy to-day possesses no comprehensive and well-established theory
of this kind, but looks to the future for the solution of this the
greatest pending problem of solar physics. Progress has been made
toward its solution, and among the steps of this progress that we shall
have to consider, the first and most important is the conception of the
sun as a kind of heat engine.

In a steam engine coal is burned under the boiler, and its chemical
energy, transformed into heat, is taken up by the water and delivered,
through steam as a medium, to the engine, which again transforms and
gives it out as mechanical work in the turning of shafts, the driving of
machinery, etc. Now, the function of the sun is exactly opposite to that
of the engine and boiler: it gives out, instead of receiving, radiant
energy; but, like the engine, it must be fed from some source; it can
not be run upon nothing at all any more than the engine can run day
after day without fresh supplies of fuel under its boiler. We know that
for some thousands of years the sun has been furnishing light and heat
to the earth in practically unvarying amount, and not to the earth
alone, but it has been pouring forth these forms of energy in every
direction, without apparent regard to either use or economy. Of all the
radiant energy given off by the sun, only two parts out of every
thousand million fall upon any planet of the solar system, and of this
small fraction the earth takes about one tenth for the maintenance of
its varied forms of life and action. Astronomers and physicists have
sought on every hand for an explanation of the means by which this
tremendous output of energy is maintained century after century without
sensible diminution, and have come with almost one mind to the
conclusion that the gravitative forces which reside in the sun's own
mass furnish the only adequate explanation for it, although they may be
in some small measure re-enforced by minor influences, such as the fall
of meteoric dust and stones into the sun.

Every boy who has inflated a bicycle tire with a hand pump knows that
the pump grows warm during the operation, on account of the compression
of the air within the cylinder. A part of the muscular force (energy)
expended in working the pump reappears in the heat which warms both air
and pump, and a similar process is forever going on in the sun, only in
place of muscular force we must there substitute the tremendous
attraction of gravitation, 28 times as great as upon the earth. "The
matter in the interior of the sun must be as a shuttlecock between the
stupendous pressure and the enormously high temperature," the one
tending to compress and the other to expand it, but with this important
difference between them: the temperature steadily tends to fall as the
heat energy is wasted away, while the gravitative force suffers no
corresponding diminution, and in the long run must gain the upper hand,
causing the sun to shrink and become more dense. It is this progressive
shrinking and compression of its molecules into a smaller space which
supplies the energy contained in the sun's output of light and heat.
According to Lord Kelvin, each centimeter of shrinkage in the sun's
diameter furnishes the energy required to keep up its radiation for
something more than an hour, and, on account of the sun's great
distance, the shrinkage might go on at this rate for many centuries
without producing any measurable effect in the sun's appearance.

127. GASEOUS CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN.--But Helmholtz's dynamical theory
of the maintenance of the sun's heat, which we are here considering,
includes one essential feature that is not sufficiently stated above. In
order that the explanation may hold true, it is necessary that the sun
should be in the main a gaseous body, composed from center to
circumference of gases instead of solid or liquid parts. Pumping air
warms the bicycle pump in a way that pumping water or oil will not.

The high temperature of the sun itself furnishes sufficient reason for
supposing the solar material to be in the gaseous state, but the gas
composing those parts of the sun below the photosphere must be very
different in some of its characteristics from the air or other gases
with which we are familiar at the earth, since its average density is
1,000 times as great as that of air, and its consistence and mechanical
behavior must be more like that of honey or tar than that of any gas
with which we are familiar. It is worth noting, however, that if a hole
were dug into the crust of the earth to a depth of 15 or 20 miles the
air at the bottom of the hole would be compressed by that above it to a
density comparable with that of the solar gases.

128. THE SUN'S CIRCULATION.--It is plain that under the conditions which
exist in the sun the outer portions, which can radiate their heat freely
into space, must be cooler than the inner central parts, and this
difference of temperature must set up currents of hot matter drifting
upward and outward from within the sun and counter currents of cooler
matter settling down to take its place. So, too, there must be some
level at which the free radiation into outer space chills the hot matter
sufficiently to condense its less refractory gases into clouds made up
of liquid drops, just as on a cloudy day there is a level in our own
atmosphere at which the vapor of water condenses into liquid drops which
form the thin shell of clouds that hovers above the earth's surface,
while above and below is the gaseous atmosphere. In the case of the sun
this cloud layer is always present and is that part which we have
learned to call the photosphere. Above the photosphere lies the
chromosphere, composed of gases less easily liquefied, hydrogen is the
chief one, while between photosphere and chromosphere is a thin layer of
metallic vapors, perhaps indistinguishable from the top crust of the
photosphere itself, which by absorbing the light given off from the
liquid photosphere produces the greater part of the Fraunhofer lines in
the solar spectrum.

From time to time the hot matter struggling up from below breaks through
the photosphere and, carrying with it a certain amount of the metallic
vapors, is launched into the upper and cooler regions of the sun,
where, parting with its heat, it falls back again upon the photosphere
and is absorbed into it. It is altogether probable that the corona is
chiefly composed of fine particles ejected from the sun with velocities
sufficient to carry them to a height of millions of miles, or even
sufficient to carry them off never to return. The matter of the corona
must certainly be in a state of the most lively agitation, its particles
being alternately hurled up from the photosphere and falling back again
like fireworks, the particles which make up the corona of to-day being
quite a different set from those of yesterday or last week. It seems
beyond question that the prominences and faculæ too are produced in some
way by this up-and-down circulation of the sun's matter, and that any
mechanical explanation of the sun must be worked out along these lines;
but the problem is an exceedingly difficult one, and must include and
explain many other features of the sun's activity of which only a few
can be considered here.

129. THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD.--Sun spots come and go, and at best any
particular spot is but short-lived, rarely lasting more than a month or
two, and more often its duration is a matter of only a few days. They
are not equally numerous at all times, but, like swarms of locusts, they
seem to come and abound for a season and then almost to disappear, as if
the forces which produced them were of a periodic character alternately
active and quiet. The effect of this periodic activity since 1870 is
shown in Fig. 81, where the horizontal line is a scale of times, and the
distance of the curve above this line for any year shows the relative
number of spots which appeared upon the sun in that year. This indicates
very plainly that 1870, 1883, and 1893 were years of great sun-spot
activity, while 1879 and 1889 were years in which few spots appeared.
The older records, covering a period of two centuries, show the same
fluctuations in the frequency of sun spots and from these records
curves (which may be found in Young's, The Sun) have been plotted,
showing a succession of waves extending back for many years.

[Illustration: FIG. 81.--The curve of sun-spot frequency.]

The sun-spot period is the interval of time from the crest or hollow of
one wave to the corresponding part of the next one, and on the average
this appears to be a little more than eleven years, but is subject to
considerable variation. In accordance with this period there is drawn in
broken lines at the right of Fig. 81 a predicted continuation of the
sun-spot curve for the first decade of the twentieth century. The
irregularity shown by the three preceding waves is such that we must not
expect the actual course of future sun spots to correspond very closely
to the prediction here made; but in a general way 1901 and 1911 will
probably be years of few sun spots, while they will be numerous in 1905,
but whether more or less numerous than at preceding epochs of greatest
frequency can not be foretold with any approach to certainty so long as
we remain in our present ignorance of the causes which make the sun-spot
period.

Determine from Fig. 81 as accurately as possible the length of the
sun-spot period. It is hard to tell the exact position of a crest or
hollow of the curve. Would it do to draw a horizontal line midway
between top and bottom of the curve and determine the length of the
period from its intersections with the curve--e. g., in 1874 and 1885?

[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Illustrating change of the sun-spot zones.]

130. THE SUN-SPOT ZONES.--It has been already noted that sun spots are
found only in certain zones of latitude upon the sun, and that faculæ
and eruptive prominences abound in these zones more than elsewhere,
although not strictly confined to them. We have now to note a
peculiarity of these zones which ought to furnish a clew to the sun's
mechanism, although up to the present time it has not been successfully
traced out. Just before a sun-spot minimum the few spots which appear
are for the most part clustered near the sun's equator. As these spots
die out two new groups appear, one north the other south of the sun's
equator and about 25° or 30° distant from it, and as the period advances
toward a maximum these groups shift their positions more and more toward
the equator, thus approaching each other but leaving between them a
vacant lane, which becomes steadily narrower until at the close of the
period, when the next minimum is at hand, it reaches its narrowest
dimensions, but does not altogether close up even then. In Fig. 82 these
relations are shown for the period falling between 1879 and 1890, by
means of the horizontal lines; for each year one line in the northern
and one in the southern hemisphere of the sun, their lengths being
proportional to the number of spots which appeared in the corresponding
hemisphere during the year, and their positions on the sun's disk
showing the average latitude of the spots in question. It is very
apparent from the figure that during this decade the sun's southern
hemisphere was much more active than the northern one in the production
of spots, and this appears to be generally the case, although the
difference is not usually as great as in this particular decade.

131. INFLUENCE OF THE SUN-SPOT PERIOD.--Sun spots are certainly less hot
than the surrounding parts of the sun's surface, and, in view of the
intimate dependence of the earth upon the solar radiation, it would be
in no way surprising if their presence or absence from the sun's face
should make itself felt in some degree upon the earth, raising and
lowering its temperature and quite possibly affecting it in other ways.
Ingenious men have suggested many such kinds of influence, which,
according to their investigations, appear to run in cycles of eleven
years. Abundant and scanty harvests, cyclones, tornadoes, epidemics,
rainfall, etc., are among these alleged effects, and it is possible that
there may be a real connection between any or all of them and the
sun-spot period, but for the most part astronomers are inclined to hold
that there is only one case in which the evidence is strong enough to
really establish a connection of this kind. The magnetic condition of
the earth and its disturbances, which are called magnetic storms, do
certainly follow in a very marked manner the course of sun-spot
activity, and perhaps there should be added to this the statement that
auroras (northern lights) stand in close relation to these magnetic
disturbances and are most frequent at the times of sun-spot maxima.

Upon the sun, however, the influence of the spot period is not limited
to things in and near the photosphere, but extends to the outermost
limits of the corona. Determine from Fig. 81 the particular part of the
sun-spot period corresponding to the date of each picture of the corona
and note how the pictures which were taken near times of sun-spot minima
present a general agreement in the shape and extent of the corona, while
the pictures taken at a time of maximum activity of the sun spots show a
very differently shaped and much smaller corona.

132. THE LAW OF THE SUN'S ROTATION.--We have seen in a previous part of
the chapter how the time required by the sun to make a complete rotation
upon its axis may be determined from photographs showing the progress of
a spot or group of spots across its disk, and we have now to add that
when this is done systematically by means of many spots situated in
different solar latitudes it leads to a very peculiar and extraordinary
result. Each particular parallel of latitude has its own period of
rotation different from that of its neighbors on either side, so that
there can be no such thing as a fixed geography of the sun's surface.
Every part of it is constantly taking up a new position with respect to
every other part, much as if the Gulf of Mexico should be south of the
United States this year, southeast of it next year, and at the end of a
decade should have shifted around to the opposite side of the earth from
us. A meridian of longitude drawn down the Mississippi Valley remains
always a straight line, or, rather, great circle, upon the surface of
the earth, while Fig. 83 shows what would become of such a meridian
drawn through the equatorial parts of the sun's disk. In the first
diagram it appears as a straight line running down the middle of the
sun's disk. Twenty-five days later, when the same face of the sun comes
back into view again, after making a complete revolution about the axis,
the equatorial parts will have moved so much faster and farther than
those in higher latitudes that the meridian will be warped as in the
second diagram, and still more warped after another and another
revolution, as shown in the figure.

[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Effect of the sun's peculiar rotation in
warping a meridian, originally straight.]

At least such is the case if the spots truly represent the way in which
the sun turns round. There is, however, a possibility that the spots
themselves drift with varying speeds across the face of the sun, and
that the differences which we find in their rates of motion belong to
them rather than to the photosphere. Just what happens in the regions
near the poles is hard to say, for the sun spots only extend about
halfway from the equator to the poles, and the spectroscope, which may
be made to furnish a certain amount of information bearing upon the
case, is not as yet altogether conclusive, nor are the faculæ which have
also been observed for this purpose.

The simple theory that the solar phenomena are caused by an interchange
of hotter and cooler matter between the photosphere and the lower strata
of the sun furnishes in its present shape little or no explanation of
such features as the sun-spot period, the variations in the corona, the
peculiar character of the sun's rotation, etc., and we have still
unsolved in the mechanical theory of the sun one of the noblest problems
of astronomy, and one upon which both observers and theoretical
astronomers are assiduously working at the present time. A close watch
is kept upon sun spots and prominences, the corona is observed at every
total eclipse, and numerous are the ingenious methods which are being
suggested and tried for observing it without an eclipse in ordinary
daylight. Attempts, more or less plausible, have been made and are now
pending to explain photosphere, spots and the reversing layer by means
of the refraction of light within the sun's outer envelope of gases, and
it seems altogether probable, in view of these combined activities, that
a considerable addition to our store of knowledge concerning the sun may
be expected in the not distant future.




CHAPTER XI

THE PLANETS


133. PLANETS.--Circling about the sun, under the influence of his
attraction, is a family of planets each member of which is, like the
moon, a dark body shining by reflected sunlight, and therefore
presenting phases; although only two of them, Mercury and Venus, run
through the complete series--new, first quarter, full, last
quarter--which the moon presents. The way in which their orbits are
grouped about the sun has been considered in Chapter III, and Figs. 16
and 17 of that chapter may be completed so as to represent all of the
planets by drawing in Fig. 16 two circles with radii of 7.9 and 12.4
centimeters respectively, to represent the orbits of the planets Uranus
and Neptune, which are more remote from the sun than Saturn, and by
introducing a little inside the orbit of Jupiter about 500 ellipses of
different sizes, shapes, and positions to represent a group of minor
planets or asteroids as they are often called. It is convenient to
regard these asteroids as composing by themselves a class of very small
planets, while the remaining 8 larger planets fall naturally into two
other classes, a group of medium-sized ones--Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
Mars--called inner planets by reason of their nearness to the sun; and
the outer planets--Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune--each of which is
much larger and more massive than any planet of the inner group. Compare
in Figs. 84 and 85 their relative sizes. The earth, _E_, is introduced
into Fig. 85 as a connecting link between the two figures.

Some of these planets, like the earth, are attended by one or more
moons, technically called satellites, which also shine by reflected
sunlight and which move about their respective planets in accordance
with the law of gravitation, much as the moon moves around the earth.

[Illustration: FIG. 84.--The inner planets and the moon.]

[Illustration: FIG. 85.--The outer planets.]

134. DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS FROM THE SUN.--It is a comparatively
simple matter to observe these planets year after year as they move
among the stars, and to find from these observations how long each one
of them requires to make its circuit around the sun--that is, its
periodic time, _T_, which figures in Kepler's Third Law, and when these
periodic times have been ascertained, to use them in connection with
that law to determine the mean distance of each planet from the sun.
Thus, Jupiter requires 4,333 days to move completely around its orbit;
and comparing this with the periodic time and mean distance of the earth
we find--

    a^{3} / (4333^{2}) = (93,000,000^{3}) / (365.25^{2}),

which when solved gives as the mean distance of Jupiter from the sun,
483,730,000 miles, or 5.20 times as distant as the earth. If we make a
similar computation for each planet, we shall find that their distances
from the sun show a remarkable agreement with an artificial series of
numbers called Bode's law. We write down the numbers contained in the
first line of figures below, each of which, after the second, is
obtained by doubling the preceding one, add 4 to each number and point
off one place of decimals; the resulting number is (approximately) the
distance of the corresponding planet from the sun.

 Mercury.  Venus.  Earth.  Mars.    Jupiter.  Saturn.  Uranus.  Neptune.
    0        3       6      12   24   48        96       192      384
    4        4       4       4    4    4         4         4        4
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   0.4      0.7     1.0    1.6  2.8  5.2      10.0      19.6     38.8
   0.4      0.7     1.0    1.5  2.8  5.2       9.5      19.2     30.1

The last line of figures shows the real distance of the planet as
determined from Kepler's law, the earth's mean distance from the sun
being taken as the unit for this purpose. With exception of Neptune, the
agreement between Bode's law and the true distances is very striking,
but most remarkable is the presence in the series of a number, 2.8, with
no planet corresponding to it. This led astronomers at the time Bode
published the law, something more than a century ago, to give new heed
to a suggestion made long before by Kepler, that there might be an
unknown planet moving between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and a
number of them agreed to search for such a planet, each in a part of the
sky assigned him for that purpose. But they were anticipated by Piazzi,
an Italian, who found the new planet, by accident, on the first day of
the nineteenth century, moving at a distance from the sun represented by
the number 2.77.

This planet was the first of the asteroids, and in the century that has
elapsed hundreds of them have been discovered, while at the present time
no year passes by without several more being added to the number. While
some of these are nearer to the sun than is the first one discovered,
and others are farther from it, their average distance is fairly
represented by the number 2.8.

Why Bode's law should hold true, or even so nearly true as it does, is
an unexplained riddle, and many astronomers are inclined to call it no
law at all, but only a chance coincidence--an illustration of the
"inherent capacity of figures to be juggled with"; but if so, it is
passing strange that it should represent the distance of the asteroids
and of Uranus, which was also an undiscovered planet at the time the law
was published.

135. THE PLANETS COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER.--When we pass from general
considerations to a study of the individual peculiarities of the
planets, we find great differences in the extent of knowledge concerning
them, and the reason for this is not far to seek. Neptune and Uranus, at
the outskirts of the solar system, are so remote from us and so feebly
illumined by the sun that any detailed study of them can go but little
beyond determining the numbers which represent their size, mass,
density, the character of their orbits, etc. The asteroids are so small
that in the telescope they look like mere points of light, absolutely
indistinguishable in appearance from the fainter stars. Mercury,
although closer at hand and presenting a disk of considerable size,
always stands so near the sun that its observation is difficult on this
account. Something of the same kind is true for Venus, although in much
less degree; while Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are comparatively easy
objects for telescopic study, and our knowledge of them, while far from
complete, is considerably greater than for the other planets.

Figs. 84 and 85 show the relative sizes of the planets composing the
inner and outer groups respectively, and furnish the numerical data
concerning their diameters, masses, densities, etc., which are of most
importance in judging of their physical condition. Each planet, save
Saturn, is represented by two circles, of which the outer is drawn
proportional to the size of the planet, and the inner shows the amount
of material that must be subtracted from the interior in order that the
remaining shell shall just float in water. Note the great difference in
thickness of shell between the two groups. Saturn, having a mean density
less than that of water, must have something loaded upon it, instead of
removed, in order that it should float just submerged.


JUPITER

136. APPEARANCE.--Commencing our consideration of the individual planets
with Jupiter, which is by far the largest of them, exceeding both in
bulk and mass all the others combined, we have in Fig. 86 four
representations of Jupiter and his family of satellites as they may be
seen in a very small telescope--e. g., an opera glass--save that the
little dots which here represent the satellites are numbered _1_, _2_,
_3_, _4_, in order to preserve their identity in the successive
pictures.

The chief interest of these pictures lies in the satellites, but,
reserving them for future consideration, we note that the planet itself
resembles in shape the full moon, although in respect of brightness it
sends to us less than 1/6000 part as much light as the moon. From a
consideration of the motion of Jupiter and the earth in Fig. 16, show
that Jupiter can not present any such phases as does the moon, but that
its disk must be at all times nearly full. As seen from Saturn, what
kind of phases would Jupiter present?

137. THE BELTS.--Even upon the small scale of Fig. 86 we detect the most
characteristic feature of Jupiter's appearance in the telescope, the two
bands extending across his face parallel to the line of the satellites,
and in Fig. 87 these same dark bands may be recognized amid the
abundance of detail which is here brought out by a large telescope.
Photography does not succeed as a means of reproducing this detail, and
for it we have to rely upon the skill of the artist astronomer. The
lettering shows the Pacific Standard time at which the sketches were
made, and also the longitude of the meridian of Jupiter passing down the
center of the planet's disk.

[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Jupiter and his satellites.]

[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Drawings of Jupiter made at the 36-inch
telescope of the Lick Observatory.--KEELER.]

The dark bands are called technically the belts of Jupiter; and a
comparison of these belts in the second and third pictures of the group,
in which nearly the same face of the planet is turned toward us, will
show that they are subject to considerable changes of form and position
even within the space of a few days. So, too, by a comparison of such
markings as the round white spots in the upper parts of the disks, and
the indentations in the edges of the belts, we may recognize that the
planet is in the act of turning round, and must therefore have an axis
about which it turns, and poles, an equator, etc. The belts are in fact
parallel to the planet's equator; and generalizing from what appears in
the pictures, we may say that there is always a strongly marked belt on
each side of the equator with a lighter colored streak between them,
and that farther from the equator are other belts variable in number,
less conspicuous, and less permanent than the two first seen. Compare
the position of the principal belts with the position of the zones of
sun-spot activity in the sun. A feature of the planet's surface, which
can not be here reproduced, is the rich color effect to be found upon
it. The principal belts are a brick-red or salmon color, the intervening
spaces in general white but richly mottled, and streaked with purples,
browns, and greens.

The drawings show the planet as it appeared in the telescope, inverted,
and they must be turned upside down if we wish the points of the compass
to appear as upon a terrestrial map. Bearing this in mind, note in the
last picture the great oval spot in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter.
This is a famous marking, known from its color as the _great red spot_,
which appeared first in 1878 and has persisted to the present day
(1900), sometimes the most conspicuous marking on the planet, at others
reduced to a mere ghost of itself, almost invisible save for the
indentation which it makes in the southern edge of the belt near it.

138. ROTATION AND FLATTENING AT THE POLES.--One further significant fact
with respect to Jupiter may be obtained from a careful measurement of
the drawings; the planet is flattened at the poles, so that its polar
diameter is about one sixteenth part shorter than the equatorial
diameter. The flattening of the earth amounts to only one
three-hundredth part, and the marked difference between these two
numbers finds its explanation in the greater swiftness of Jupiter's
rotation about its axis, since in both cases it is this rotation which
makes the flattening.

It is not easy to determine the precise dimensions of the planet, since
this involves a knowledge both of its distance from us and of the angle
subtended by its diameter, but the most recent determinations of this
kind assign as the equatorial diameter 90,200 miles, and for the polar
diameter 84,400 miles. Determine from either of these numbers the size
of the great red spot.

The earth turns on its axis once in 24 hours but no such definite time
can be assigned to Jupiter, which, like the sun, seems to have different
rotation periods in different latitudes--9h. 50m. in the equatorial belt
and 9h. 56m. in the dark belts and higher latitudes. There is some
indication that the larger part of the visible surface rotates in 9h.
55.6m., while a broad stream along the equator flows eastward some 270
miles per hour, and thus comes back to the center of the planet, as seen
from the earth, five or six minutes earlier than the parts which do not
share in this motion. Judged by terrestrial standards, 270 miles per
hour is a great velocity, but Jupiter is constructed on a colossal
scale, and, too, we have to compare this movement, not to a current
flowing in the ocean, but to a wind blowing in the upper regions of the
earth's atmosphere. The visible surface of Jupiter is only the top of a
cloud formation, and contains nothing solid or permanent, if indeed
there is anything solid even at the core of the planet. The great red
spot during the first dozen years of its existence, instead of remaining
fixed relative to the surrounding formations, drifted two thirds of the
way around the planet, and having come to a standstill about 1891, it is
now slowly retracing its path.

139. PHYSICAL CONDITION.--For a better understanding of the physical
condition of Jupiter, we have now to consider some independent lines of
evidence which agree in pointing to the conclusion that Jupiter,
although classed with the earth as a planet, is in its essential
character much more like the sun.

_Appearance._--The formations which we see in Fig. 87 look like clouds.
They gather and disappear, and the only element of permanence about them
is their tendency to group themselves along zones of latitude. If we
measure the light reflected from the planet we find that its albedo is
very high, like that of snow or our own cumulus clouds, and it is of
course greater from the light parts of the disk than from the darker
bands. The spectroscope shows that the sunlight reflected from these
darker belts is like that reflected from the lighter parts, save that a
larger portion of the blue and violet rays has been absorbed out of it,
thus producing the ruddy tint of the belts, as sunset colors are
produced on the earth, and showing that here the light has penetrated
farther into the planet's atmosphere before being thrown back by
reflection from lower-lying cloud surfaces. The dark bands are therefore
to be regarded as rifts in the clouds, reaching down to some
considerable distance and indicating an atmosphere of great depth. The
great red spot, 28,000 miles long, and obviously thrusting back the
white clouds on every side of it, year after year, can hardly be a mere
patch on the face of the planet, but indicates some considerable depth
of atmosphere.

_Density._--So, too, the small mean density of the planet, only 1.3
times that of water and actually less than the density of the sun,
suggests that the larger part of the planet's bulk may be made of gases
and clouds, with very little solid matter even at the center; but here
we get into a difficulty from which there seems but one escape. The
force of gravity at the visible surface of Jupiter may be found from its
mass and dimensions to be 2.6 times as great as at the surface of the
earth, and the pressure exerted upon its atmosphere by this force ought
to compress the lower strata into something more dense than we find in
the planet. Some idea of this compression may be obtained from Fig. 88,
where the line marked _E_ shows approximately how the density of the air
increases as we move from its upper strata down toward the surface of
the earth through a distance of 16 miles, the density at any level being
proportional to the distance of the curved line from the straight one
near it. The line marked _J_ in the same figure shows how the density
would increase if the force of gravity were as great here as it is in
Jupiter, and indicates a much greater rate of increase. Starting from
the upper surface of the cloud in Jupiter's atmosphere, if we descend,
not 16 miles, but 1,600 or 16,000, what must the density of the
atmosphere become and how is this to be reconciled with what we know to
be the very small mean density of the planet?

We are here in a dilemma between density on the one hand and the effects
of gravity on the other, and the only escape from it lies in the
assumption that the interior of Jupiter is tremendously hot, and that
this heat expands the substance of the planet in spite of the pressure
to which it is subject, making a large planet with a low density,
possibly gaseous at the very center, but in its outer part surrounded by
a shell of clouds condensed from the gases by radiating their heat into
the cold of outer space.

[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Increase of density in the atmospheres of
Jupiter and the earth.]

This is essentially the same physical condition that we found for the
sun, and we may add, as further points of resemblance between it and
Jupiter, that there seems to be a circulation of matter from the hot
interior of the planet to its cooler surface that is more pronounced in
the southern hemisphere than in the northern, and that has its periods
of maximum and minimum activity, which, curiously enough, seem to
coincide with periods of maximum and minimum sun-spot development. Of
this, however, we can not be entirely sure, since it is only in recent
years that it has been studied with sufficient care, and further
observations are required to show whether the agreement is something
more than an accidental and short-lived coincidence.

_Temperature._--The temperature of Jupiter must, of course, be much
lower than that of the sun, since the surface which we see is not
luminous like the sun's; but below the clouds it is not improbable that
Jupiter may be incandescent, white hot, and it is surmised with some
show of probability that a little of its light escapes through the
clouds from time to time, and helps to produce the striking brilliancy
with which this planet shines.

140. THE SATELLITES OF JUPITER.--The satellites bear much the same
relation to Jupiter that the moon bears to the earth, revolving about
the planet in accordance with the law of gravitation, and conforming to
Kepler's three laws, as do the planets in their courses about the sun.
Observe in Fig. 86 the position of satellite No. _1_ on the four dates,
and note how it oscillates back and forth from left to right of Jupiter,
apparently making a complete revolution in about two days, while No. _4_
moves steadily from left to right during the entire period, and has
evidently made only a fraction of a revolution in the time covered by
the pictures. This quicker motion, of course, means that No. _1_ is
nearer to Jupiter than No. _4_, and the numbers given to the satellites
show the order of their distances from the planet. The peculiar way in
which the satellites are grouped, always standing nearly in a straight
line, shows that their orbits must lie nearly in the same plane, and
that this plane, which is also the plane of the planets' equator, is
turned edgewise toward the earth.

These satellites enjoy the distinction of being the first objects ever
discovered with the telescope, having been found by Galileo almost
immediately after its invention, A. D. 1610. It is quite possible that
before this time they may have been seen with the naked eye, for in more
recent years reports are current that they have been seen under
favorable circumstances by sharp-eyed persons, and very little
telescopic aid is required to show them. Look for them with an opera or
field glass. They bear the names Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, which,
however, are rarely used, and, following the custom of astronomers, we
shall designate them by the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV.

[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Orbits of Jupiter's satellites.]

For nearly three centuries (1610 to 1892) astronomers spoke of the four
satellites of Jupiter; but in September, 1892, a fifth one was added to
the number by Professor Barnard, who, observing with the largest
telescope then extant, found very close to Jupiter a tiny object only
1/600 part as bright as the other satellites, but, like them, revolving
around Jupiter, a permanent member of his system. This is called the
fifth satellite, and Fig. 89 shows the orbits of these satellites around
Jupiter, which is here represented on the same scale as the orbits
themselves. The broken line just inside the orbit of I represents the
size of the moon's orbit. The cut shows also the periodic times of the
satellites expressed in days, and furnishes in this respect a striking
illustration of the great mass of Jupiter. Satellite I is a little
farther from Jupiter than is the moon from the earth, but under the
influence of a greater attraction it makes the circuit of its orbit in
1.77 days, instead of taking 29.53 days, as does the moon. Determine
from the figure by the method employed in § 111 how much more massive is
Jupiter than the earth.

Small as these satellites seem in Fig. 86, they are really bodies of
considerable size, as appears from Fig. 90, where their dimensions are
compared with those of the earth and moon, save that the fifth satellite
is not included. This one is so small as to escape all attempts at
measuring its diameter, but, judging from the amount of light it
reflects, the period printed with the legend of the figure represents a
gross exaggeration of this satellite's size.

[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Jupiter's satellites compared with the earth
and moon.]

Like the moon, each of these satellites may fairly be considered a world
in itself, and as such a fitting object of detailed study, but,
unfortunately, their great distance from us makes it impossible, even
with the most powerful telescope, to see more upon their surfaces than
occasional vague markings, which hardly suffice to show the rotations of
the satellites upon their axes.

One striking feature, however, comes out from a study of their influence
in disturbing each other's motion about Jupiter. Their masses and the
resulting densities of the satellites are smaller than we should have
expected to find, the density being less than that of the moon, and
averaging only a little greater than the density of Jupiter itself. At
the surface of the third satellite the force of gravity is but little
less than on the moon, although the moon's density is nearly twice as
great as that of III, and there can be no question here of accounting
for the low density through expansion by great heat, as in the case of
the sun and Jupiter. It has been surmised that these satellites are not
solid bodies, like the earth and moon, but only shoals of rock and
stone, loosely piled together and kept from packing into a solid mass by
the action of Jupiter in raising tides within them. But the explanation
can hardly be regarded as an accepted article of astronomical belief,
although it is supported by some observations which tend to show that
the apparent shapes of the satellites change under the influence of the
tidal forces impressed upon them.

141. ECLIPSES OF THE SATELLITES.--It may be seen from Fig. 89 that in
their motion around the planet Jupiter's satellites must from time to
time pass through his shadow and be eclipsed, and that the shadows of
the satellites will occasionally fall upon the planet, producing to an
observer upon Jupiter an eclipse of the sun, but to an observer on the
earth presenting only the appearance of a round black spot moving slowly
across the face of the planet. Occasionally also a satellite will pass
exactly between the earth and Jupiter, and may be seen projected against
the planet as a background. All of these phenomena are duly predicted
and observed by astronomers, but the eclipses are the only ones we need
consider here. The importance of these eclipses was early recognized,
and astronomers endeavored to construct a theory of their recurrence
which would permit accurate predictions of them to be made. But in this
they met with no great success, for while it was easy enough to foretell
on what night an eclipse of a given satellite would occur, and even to
assign the hour of the night, it was not possible to make the predicted
minute agree with the actual time of eclipse until after Roemer, a
Danish astronomer of the seventeenth century, found where lay the
trouble. His discovery was, that whenever the earth was on the side of
its orbit toward Jupiter the eclipses really occurred before the
predicted time, and when the earth was on the far side of its orbit they
came a few minutes later than the predicted time. He correctly inferred
that this was to be explained, not by any influence which the earth
exerted upon Jupiter and his satellites, but through the fact that the
light by which we see the satellite and its eclipse requires an
appreciable time to cross the intervening space, and a longer time when
the earth is far from Jupiter than when it is near.

For half a century Roemer's views found little credence, but we know now
that he was right, and that on the average the eclipses come 8m. 18s.
early when the earth is nearest to Jupiter, and 8m. 18s. late when it is
on the opposite side of its orbit. This is equivalent to saying that
light takes 8m. 18s. to cover the distance from the sun to the earth, so
that at any moment we see the sun not as it then is, but as it was 8
minutes earlier. It has been found possible in recent years to measure
by direct experiment the velocity with which light travels--186,337
miles per second--and multiplying this number by the 498s. (= 8m. 18s.)
we obtain a new determination of the sun's distance from the earth. The
product of the two numbers is 92,795,826, in very fair agreement with
the 93,000,000 miles found in Chapter X; but, as noted there, this
method, like every other, has its weak side, and the result may be a
good many thousands of miles in error.

It is worthy of note in this connection that both methods of obtaining
the sun's distance which were given in Chapter X involve Kepler's Third
Law, while the result obtained from Jupiter's satellites is entirely
independent of this law, and the agreement of the several results is
therefore good evidence both for the truth of Kepler's laws and for the
soundness of Roemer's explanation of the eclipses. This mode of proof,
by comparing the numerical results furnished by two or more different
principles, and showing that they agree or disagree, is of wide
application and great importance in physical science.


SATURN

142. THE RING OF SATURN.--In respect of size and mass Saturn stands next
to Jupiter, and although far inferior to him in these respects, it
contains more material than all the remaining planets combined. But the
unique feature of Saturn which distinguishes it from every other known
body in the heavens is its ring, which was long a puzzle to the
astronomers who first studied the planet with a telescope (one of them
called Saturn a planet with ears), but, was after nearly half a century
correctly understood and described by Huyghens, whose Latin text we
translate into--"It is surrounded by a ring, thin, flat, nowhere
touching it, and making quite an angle with the ecliptic."

[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Aspects of Saturn's rings.]

Compare with this description Fig. 91, which shows some of the
appearances presented by the ring at different positions of Saturn in
its orbit. It was their varying aspects that led Huyghens to insert the
last words of his description, for, if the plane of the ring coincided
with the plane of the earth's orbit, then at all times the ring must be
turned edgewise toward the earth, as shown in the middle picture of the
group. Fig. 92 shows the sun and the orbit of the earth placed near the
center of Saturn's orbit, across whose circumference are ruled some
oblique lines representing the plane of the ring, the right end always
tilted up, no matter where the planet is in its orbit. It is evident
that an observer upon the earth will see the _N_ side of the ring when
the planet is at _N_ and the _S_ side when it is at _S_, as is shown in
the first and third pictures of Fig. 91, while midway between these
positions the edge of the ring will be presented to the earth.

[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Aspects of the ring in their relation to
Saturn's orbital motion.]

The last occasion of this kind was in October, 1891, and with the large
telescope of the Washburn Observatory the writer at that time saw
Saturn without a trace of a ring surrounding it. The ring is so thin
that it disappears altogether when turned edgewise. The names of the
zodiacal constellations are inserted in Fig. 92 in their proper
direction from the sun, and from these we learn that the ring will
disappear, or be exceedingly narrow, whenever Saturn is in the
constellation Pisces or near the boundary line between Leo and Virgo. It
will be broad and show its northern side when Saturn is in Scorpius or
Sagittarius, and its southern face when the planet is in Gemini. What
will be its appearance in 1907 at the date marked in the figure?

143. NATURE OF THE RING.--It is apparent from Figs. 91 and 93 that
Saturn's ring is really made up of two or more rings lying one inside of
the other and completely separated by a dark space which, though narrow,
is as clean and sharp as if cut with a knife. Also, the inner edge of
the ring fades off into an obscure border called the _dusky ring_ or
_crape ring_. This requires a pretty good telescope to show it, as may
be inferred from the fact that it escaped notice for more than two
centuries during which the planet was assiduously studied with
telescopes, and was discovered at the Harvard College Observatory as
recently as 1850.

Although the rings appear oval in all of the pictures, this is mainly an
effect of perspective, and they are in fact nearly circular with the
planet at their center. The extreme diameter of the ring is 172,000
miles, and from this number, by methods already explained (Chapter IX),
the student should obtain the width of the rings, their distance from
the ball of the planet, and the diameter of the ball. As to thickness,
it is evident, from the disappearance of the ring when its edge is
turned toward the earth, that it is very thin in comparison with its
diameter, probably not more than 100 miles thick, although no exact
measurement of this can be made.

[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Saturn.]

From theoretical reasons based upon the law of gravitation astronomers
have held that the rings of Saturn could not possibly be solid or
liquid bodies. The strains impressed upon them by the planet's
attraction would tear into fragments steel rings made after their size
and shape. Quite recently Professor Keeler has shown, by applying the
spectroscope (Doppler's principle) to determine the velocity of the
ring's rotation about Saturn, that the inner parts of the ring move, as
Kepler's Third Law requires, more rapidly than do the outer parts, thus
furnishing a direct proof that they are not solid, and leaving no doubt
that they are made up of separate fragments, each moving about the
planet in its own orbit, like an independent satellite, but standing so
close to its neighbors that the whole space reflects the sunlight as
completely as if it were solid. With this understanding of the rings it
is easy to see why they are so thin. Like Jupiter, Saturn is greatly
flattened at the poles, and this flattening, or rather the protuberant
mass about the equator, lays hold of every satellite near the planet and
exerts upon it a direct force tending to thrust it down into the plane
of the planet's equator and hold it there. The ring lies in the plane of
Saturn's equator because each particle is constrained to move there.

The division of the ring into two parts, an outer and an inner ring, is
usually explained as follows: Saturn is surrounded by a numerous brood
of satellites, which by their attractions produce perturbations in the
material composing the rings, and the dividing line between the outer
and inner rings falls at the place where by the law of gravitation the
perturbations would have their greatest effect. The dividing line
between the rings is therefore a narrow lane, 2,400 miles wide, from
which the fragments have been swept clean away by the perturbing action
of the satellites. Less conspicuous divisions are seen from time to time
in other parts of the ring, where the perturbations, though less, are
still appreciable. But it is open to some question whether this
explanation is sufficient.

The curious darkness of the inner or crape ring is easily explained.
The particles composing it are not packed together so closely as in the
outer ring, and therefore reflect less sunlight. Indeed, so sparsely
strewn are the particles in this ring that it is in great measure
transparent to the sunlight, as is shown by a recorded observation of
one of the satellites which was distinctly although faintly seen while
moving through the shadow of the dark ring, but disappeared in total
eclipse when it entered the shadow cast by the bright ring.

144. THE BALL OF SATURN.--The ball of the planet is in most respects a
smaller copy of Jupiter. With an equatorial diameter of 76,000 miles, a
polar diameter of 69,000 miles, and a mass 95 times that of the earth,
its density is found to be the least of any planet in the solar system,
only 0.70 of the density of water, and about one half as great as is the
density of Jupiter. The force of gravity at its surface is only a little
greater (1.18) than on the earth; and this, in connection with the low
density, leads, as in the case of Jupiter, to the conclusion that the
planet must be mainly composed of gases and vapors, very hot within, but
inclosed by a shell of clouds which cuts off their glow from our eyes.

Like Jupiter in another respect, the planet turns very swiftly upon its
axis, making a revolution in 10 hours 14 minutes, but up to the present
it remains unknown whether different parts of the surface have different
rotation times.

145. THE SATELLITES.--Saturn is attended by a family of nine satellites,
a larger number than belongs to any other planet, but with one exception
they are exceedingly small and difficult to observe save with a very
large telescope. Indeed, the latest one is said to have been discovered
in 1898 by means of the image which it impressed upon a photographic
plate, and it has never been _seen_.

Titan, the largest of them, is distant 771,000 miles from the planet and
bears much the same relation to Saturn that Satellite III bears to
Jupiter, the similarity in distance, size and mass being rather
striking, although, of course, the smaller mass of Saturn as compared
with Jupiter makes the periodic time of Titan--15 days 23 hours--much
greater than that of III. Can you apply Kepler's Third Law to the motion
of Titan so as to determine from the data given above, the time required
for a particle at the outer or inner edge of the ring to revolve once
around Saturn?

Japetus, the second satellite in point of size, whose distance from
Saturn is about ten times as great as the moon's distance from the
earth, presents the remarkable peculiarity of being always brighter in
one part of its orbit than in another, three or four times as bright
when west of Saturn as when east of it. This probably indicates that,
like our own moon, the satellite turns always the same face toward its
planet, and further, that one side of the satellite reflects the
sunlight much better than the other side--i. e., has a higher albedo.
With these two assumptions it is easily seen that the satellite will
always turn toward the earth one face when west, and the other face when
east of Saturn, and thus give the observed difference of brightness.


URANUS AND NEPTUNE

146. CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS.--The two remaining large planets are
interesting chiefly as modern additions to the known members of the
sun's family. The circumstances leading to the discovery of Neptune have
been touched upon in Chapter IV, and for Uranus we need only note that
it was found by accident in the year 1781 by William Herschel, who for
some time after the discovery considered it to be only a comet. It was
the first planet ever discovered, all of its predecessors having been
known from prehistoric times.

[Illustration: WILLIAM HERSCHEL (1738-1822).]

Uranus has four satellites, all of them very faint, which present only
one feature of special importance. Instead of moving in orbits which are
approximately parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, as do the
satellites of the inner planets, their orbit planes are tipped up nearly
perpendicular to the planes of the orbits of both Uranus and the earth.
The one satellite which Neptune possesses has the same peculiarity in
even greater degree, for its motion around the planet takes place in the
direction opposite to that in which all the planets move around the sun,
much as if the orbit of the satellite had been tipped over through an
angle of 150°. Turn a watch face down and note how the hands go round in
the direction opposite to that in which they moved before the face was
turned through 180°.

Both Uranus and Neptune are too distant to allow much detail to be seen
upon their surfaces, but the presence of broad absorption bands in their
spectra shows that they must possess dense atmospheres quite different
in constitution from the atmosphere of the earth. In respect of density
and the force of gravity at their surfaces, they are not very unlike
Saturn, although their density is greater and gravity less than his,
leading to the supposition that they are for the most part gaseous
bodies, but cooler and probably more nearly solid than either Jupiter or
Saturn.

Under favorable circumstances Uranus may be seen with the naked eye by
one who knows just where to look for it. Neptune is never visible save
in a telescope.

147. THE INNER PLANETS.--In sharp contrast with the giant planets which
we have been considering stands the group of four inner planets, or five
if we count the moon as an independent body, which resemble each other
in being all small, dense, and solid bodies, which by comparison with
the great distances separating the outer planets may fairly be described
as huddled together close to the sun. Their relative sizes are shown in
Fig. 84, together with the numerical data concerning size, mass,
density, etc., which we have already found important for the
understanding of a planet's physical condition.


VENUS

[Illustration: FIG. 94.--The phases of Venus.--ANTONIADI.]

148. APPEARANCE.--Omitting the earth, Venus is by far the most
conspicuous member of this group, and when at its brightest is, with
exception of the sun and moon, the most brilliant object in the sky, and
may be seen with the naked eye in broad daylight if the observer knows
just where to look for it. But its brilliancy is subject to considerable
variations on account of its changing distance from the earth, and the
apparent size of its disk varies for the same reason, as may be seen
from Fig. 94. These drawings bring out well the phases of the planet,
and the student should determine from Fig. 17 what are the relative
positions in their orbits of the earth and Venus at which the planet
would present each of these phases. As a guide to this, observe that the
dark part of Venus's earthward side is always proportional in area to
the angle at Venus between the earth and sun. In the first picture of
Fig. 94 about two thirds of the surface corresponding to the full
hemisphere of the planet is dark, and the angle at Venus between earth
and sun is therefore two thirds of 180°--i. e., 120°. In Fig. 17 find a
place on the orbit of Venus from which if lines be drawn to the sun and
earth, as there shown, the angle between them will be 120°. Make a
similar construction for the fourth picture in Fig. 94. Which of these
two positions is farther from the earth? How do the distances compare
with the apparent size of Venus in the two pictures? What is the phase
of Venus to-day?

The irregularities in the shading of the illuminated parts of the disk
are too conspicuous in Fig. 94, on account of difficulties of
reproduction; these shadings are at the best hard to see in the
telescope, and distinct permanent markings upon the planet are wholly
lacking. This absence of markings makes almost impossible a
determination of the planet's time of rotation about its axis, and
astronomers are divided in this respect into two parties, one of which
maintains that Venus, like the earth, turns upon its axis in some period
not very different from 24 hours, while the other contends that, like
the moon, it turns always the same face toward the center of its orbit,
making a rotation upon its axis in the same period in which it makes a
revolution about the sun. The reason why no permanent markings are to be
seen on this planet is easily found. Like Jupiter and Saturn, its
atmosphere is at all times heavily cloud-laden, so that we seldom, if
ever, see down to the level of its solid parts. There is, however, no
reason here to suppose the interior parts hot and gaseous. It is much
more probable that Venus, like the earth, possesses a solid crust whose
temperature we should expect to be considerably higher than that of the
earth, because Venus is nearer the sun. But the cloud layer in its
atmosphere must modify the temperature in some degree, and we have
practically no knowledge of the real temperature conditions at the
surface of the planet.

It is the clouds of Venus which in great measure are responsible for its
marked brilliancy, since they are an excellent medium for reflecting the
sunlight, and give to its surface an albedo greater than that of any
other planet, although Saturn is nearly equal to it.

Of course, the presence of such cloud formations indicates that Venus is
surrounded by a dense atmosphere, and we have independent evidence of
this in the shape of its disk when the planet is very nearly between the
earth and sun. The illuminated part, from tip to tip of the horns, then
stretches more than halfway around the planet's circumference, and shows
that a certain amount of light must have been refracted through its
atmosphere, thus making the horns of the crescent appear unduly
prolonged. This atmosphere is shown by the spectroscope to be not unlike
that of the earth, although, possibly, more dense.


MERCURY

149. CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS.--Mercury, on account of its nearness to the
sun, is at all times a difficult object to observe, and Copernicus, who
spent most of his life in Poland, is said, despite all his efforts, to
have gone to his grave without ever seeing it. In our more southern
latitude it can usually be seen for about a fortnight at the time of
each elongation--i. e., when at its greatest angular distance from the
sun--and the student should find from Fig. 16 the time at which the next
elongation occurs and look for the planet, shining like a star of the
first magnitude, low down in the sky just after sunset or before
sunrise, according as the elongation is to the east or west of the sun.
When seen in the morning sky the planet grows brighter day after day
until it disappears in the sun's rays, while in the evening sky its
brilliancy as steadily diminishes until the planet is lost. It should
therefore be looked for in the evening as soon as possible after it
emerges from the sun's rays.

Mercury, as the smallest of the planets, is best compared with the
moon, which it does not greatly surpass in size and which it strongly
resembles in other respects. Careful comparisons of the amount of light
reflected by the planet in different parts of its orbit show not only
that its albedo agrees very closely with that of the moon, but also that
its light changes with the varying phase of the planet in almost exactly
the same way as the amount of moonlight changes. We may therefore infer
that its surface is like that of the moon, a rough and solid one, with
few or no clouds hanging over it, and most probably covered with very
little or no atmosphere. Like Venus, its rotation period is uncertain,
with the balance of probability favoring the view that it rotates upon
its axis once in 88 days, and therefore always turns the same face
toward the sun.

If such is the case, its climate must be very peculiar: one side roasted
in a perpetual day, where the direct heating power of the sun's rays,
when the planet is at perihelion, is ten times as great as on the moon,
and which six weeks later, when the planet is at its farthest from the
sun, has fallen off to less than half of this. On the opposite side of
the planet there must reign perpetual night and perpetual cold,
mitigated by some slight access of warmth from the day side, and perhaps
feebly imitating the rapid change of season which takes place on the day
side of the planet. This view, however, takes no account of a possible
deviation of the planet's axis from being perpendicular to the plane of
its orbit, or of the librations which must be produced by the great
eccentricity of the orbit, either of which would complicate without
entirely destroying the ideal conditions outlined above.


MARS

150. APPEARANCE.--The one remaining member of the inner group, Mars, has
in recent years received more attention than any other planet, and the
newspapers and magazines have announced marvelous things concerning it:
that it is inhabited by a race of beings superior in intelligence to
men; that the work of their hands may be seen upon the face of the
planet; that we should endeavor to communicate with them, if indeed they
are not already sending messages to us, etc.--all of which is certainly
important, if true, but it rests upon a very slender foundation of
evidence, a part of which we shall have to consider.

Beginning with facts of which there is no doubt, this ruddy-colored
planet, which usually shines about as brightly as a star of the first
magnitude, sometimes displays more than tenfold this brilliancy,
surpassing every other planet save Venus and presenting at these times
especially favorable opportunities for the study of its surface. The
explanation of this increase of brilliancy is, of course, that the
planet approaches unusually near to the earth, and we have already seen
from a consideration of Fig. 17 that this can only happen in the months
of August and September. The last favorable epoch of this kind was in
1894. From Fig. 17 the student should determine when the next one will
come.

[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Mars.--SCHAEBERLE.]

Fig. 95 presents nine drawings of the planet made at one of the epochs
of close approach to the earth, and shows that its face bears certain
faint markings which, though inconspicuous, are fixed and permanent
features of the planet. The dark triangular projection in the lower
half of the second drawing was seen and sketched by Huyghens, 1659
A. D. In Fig. 96 some of these markings are shown much more plainly, but
Fig. 95 gives a better idea of their usual appearance in the telescope.

[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Four views of Mars differing 90° in
longitude.--BARNARD.]

151. ROTATION.--It may be seen readily enough, from a comparison of the
first two sketches of Fig. 95, that the planet rotates about an axis,
and from a more extensive study it is found to be very like the earth in
this respect, turning once in 24h. 37m. around an axis tipped from being
perpendicular to the plane of its orbit about a degree and a half more
than is the earth's axis. Since it is this inclination of the axis which
is the cause of changing seasons upon the earth, there must be similar
changes, winter and summer, as well as day and night, upon Mars, only
each season is longer there than here in the same proportion that its
year is longer than ours--i. e., nearly two to one. It is summer in the
northern hemisphere of Mars whenever the sun, as seen from Mars, stands
in that constellation which is nearest the point of the sky toward which
the planet's axis points. But this axis points toward the constellation
Cygnus, and Alpha Cygni is the bright star nearest the north pole of
Mars. As Pisces is the zodiacal constellation nearest to Cygnus, it must
be summer in the northern hemisphere of Mars when the sun is in Pisces,
or, turning the proposition about, it must be summer in the _southern_
hemisphere of Mars when the planet, as seen from the sun, lies in the
direction of Pisces.

152. THE POLAR CAPS.--One effect of the changing seasons upon Mars is
shown in Fig. 97, where we have a series of drawings of the region about
its south pole made in 1894, on dates between May 21st and December
10th. Show from Fig. 17 that during this time it was summer in the
region here shown. Mars crossed the prime radius in 1894 on September
5th. The striking thing in these pictures is the white spot surrounding
the pole, which shrinks in size from the beginning to near the end of
the series, and then disappears altogether. The spot came back again a
year later, and like a similar spot at the north pole of the planet it
waxes in the winter and wanes during the summer of Mars in endless
succession.

[Illustration: FIG. 97.--The south polar cap of Mars in 1894.--BARNARD.]

Sir W. Herschel, who studied these appearances a century ago, compared
them with the snow fields which every winter spread out from the region
around the terrestrial pole, and in the summer melt and shrink, although
with us they do not entirely disappear. This explanation of the polar
caps of Mars has been generally accepted among astronomers, and from it
we may draw one interesting conclusion: the temperature upon Mars
between summer and winter oscillates above and below the freezing point
of water, as it does in the temperate zones of the earth. But this
conclusion plunges us into a serious difficulty. The temperature of the
earth is made by the sun, and at the distance of Mars from the sun the
heating effect of the latter is reduced to less than half what it is at
the earth, so that, if Mars is to be kept at the same temperature as the
earth, there must be some peculiar means for storing the solar heat and
using it more economically than is done here. Possibly there is some
such mechanism, although no one has yet found it, and some astronomers
are very confident that it does not exist, and assert that the
comparison of the polar caps with snow fields is misleading, and that
the temperature upon Mars must be at least 100°, and perhaps 200° or
more, below zero.

153. ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE.--In this connection one feature of Mars is
of importance. The markings upon its surface are always visible when
turned toward the earth, thus showing that the atmosphere contains no
such amount of cloud as does our own, but on the whole is decidedly
clear and sunny, and presumably much less dense than ours. We have seen
in comparing the earth and the moon how important is the service which
the earth's atmosphere renders in storing the sun's heat and checking
those great vicissitudes of temperature to which the moon is subject;
and with this in mind we must regard the smaller density and cloudless
character of the atmosphere of Mars as unfavorable to the maintenance
there of a temperature like that of the earth. Indeed, this
cloudlessness must mean one of two things: either the temperature is so
low that vapors can not exist in any considerable quantity, or the
surface of Mars is so dry that there is little water or other liquid to
be evaporated. The latter alternative is adopted by those astronomers
who look upon the polar caps as true snow fields, which serve as the
chief reservoir of the planet's water supply, and who find in Fig. 98
evidence that as the snow melts and the water flows away over the flat,
dry surface of the planet, vegetation springs up, as shown by the dark
markings on the disk, and gradually dies out with the advancing season.
Note that in the first of these pictures the season upon Mars
corresponds to the end of May with us, and in the last picture to the
beginning of August, a period during which in much of our western
country the luxuriant vegetation of spring is burned out by the
scorching sun. From this point of view the permanent dark spots are the
low-lying parts of the planet's surface, in which at all times there is
a sufficient accumulation of water to support vegetable life.

[Illustration: FIG. 98.--The same face of Mars at three different
seasons.--LOWELL.]

154. THE CANALS.--In Fig. 98 the lower part of the disk of Mars shows
certain faint dark lines which are generally called canals, and in Plate
III there is given a map of Mars showing many of these canals running in
narrow, dusky streaks across the face of the planet according to a
pattern almost as geometrical as that of a spider's web. This must not
be taken for a picture of the planet's appearance in a telescope. No man
ever saw Mars look like this, but the map is useful as a plain
representation of things dimly seen. Some of the regions of this map are
marked Mare (sea), in accordance with the older view which regarded the
darker parts of the planet--and of the moon--as bodies of water, but
this is now known to be an error in both cases. The curved surface of a
planet can not be accurately reproduced upon the flat surface of paper,
but is always more or less distorted by the various methods of
"projecting" it which are in use. Compare the map of Mars in Plate III
with Fig. 99, in which the projection represents very well the
equatorial parts of the planet, but enormously exaggerates the region
around the poles.

It is a remarkable feature of the canals that they all begin and end in
one of these dark parts of the planet's surface; they show no loose ends
lying on the bright parts of the planet. Another even more remarkable
feature is that while the larger canals are permanent features of the
planet's surface, they at times appear "doubled"--i. e., in place of one
canal two parallel ones side by side, lasting for a time and then giving
place again to a single canal.

It is exceedingly difficult to frame any reasonable explanation of these
canals and the varied appearances which they present. The source of the
wild speculations about Mars, to which reference is made above, is to be
found in the suggestion frequently made, half in jest and half in
earnest, that the canals are artificial water courses constructed upon a
scale vastly exceeding any public works upon the earth, and testifying
to the presence in Mars of an advanced civilization. The distinguished
Italian astronomer, Schiaparelli, who has studied these formations
longer than any one else, seems inclined to regard them as water courses
lined on either side by vegetation, which flourishes as far back from
the central channel as water can be supplied from it--a plausible enough
explanation if the fundamental difficulty about temperature can be
overcome.

[Illustration: FIG. 99.--A chart of Mars, 1898-'99.--CERULLI.]

[Illustration: PLATE III. MAP OF MARS (AFTER SCHIAPARELLI)]

155. SATELLITES.--In 1877, one of the times of near approach, Professor
Hall, of Washington, discovered two tiny satellites revolving about Mars
in orbits so small that the nearer one, Phobos, presents the remarkable
anomaly of completing the circuit of its orbit in less time than the
planet takes for a rotation about its axis. This satellite, in fact,
makes three revolutions in its orbit while the planet turns once upon
its axis, and it therefore rises in the west and sets in the east, as
seen from Mars, going from one horizon to the other in a little less
than 6 hours. The other satellite, Deimos, takes a few hours more than a
day to make the circuit of its orbit, but the difference is so small
that it remains continuously above the horizon of any given place upon
Mars for more than 60 hours at a time, and during this period runs twice
through its complete set of phases--new, first quarter, full, etc. In
ordinary telescopes these satellites can be seen only under especially
favorable circumstances, and are far too small to permit of any direct
measurement of their size. The amount of light which they reflect has
been compared with that of Mars and found to be as much inferior to it
as is Polaris to two full moons, and, judging from this comparison,
their diameters can not much exceed a half dozen miles, unless their
albedo is far less than that of Mars, which does not seem probable.


THE ASTEROIDS

156. MINOR PLANETS.--These may be dismissed with few words. There are
about 500 of them known, all discovered since the beginning of the
nineteenth century, and new ones are still found every year. No one
pretends to remember the names which have been assigned them, and they
are commonly represented by a number inclosed in a circle, showing the
order in which they were discovered--e. g., [circle 1] = Ceres,
[circle 433] = Eros, etc. For the most part they are little more than
chips, world fragments, adrift in space, and naturally it was the larger
and brighter of them that were first discovered. The size of the first
four of them--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta--compared with the size of
the moon, according to Professor Barnard, is shown in Fig. 100. The
great majority of them must be much smaller than the smallest of these,
perhaps not more than a score of miles in diameter.

A few of the asteroids present problems of special interest, such as
Eros, on account of its close approach to the earth; Polyhymnia, whose
very eccentric orbit makes it a valuable means for determining the mass
of Jupiter, etc.; but these are special cases and the average asteroid
now receives scant attention, although half a century ago, when only a
few of them were known, they were regarded with much interest, and the
discovery of a new one was an event of some consequence.

It was then a favorite speculation that they were in fact fragments of
an ill-fated planet which once filled the gap between the orbits of Mars
and Jupiter, but which, by some mischance, had been blown into pieces.
This is now known to be well-nigh impossible, for every fragment which
after the explosion moved in an elliptical orbit, as all the asteroids
do move, would be brought back once in every revolution to the place of
the explosion, and all the asteroid orbits must therefore intersect at
this place. But there is no such common point of intersection.

[Illustration: FIG. 100.--The size of the first four
asteroids.--BARNARD.]

157. LIFE ON THE PLANETS.--There is a belief firmly grounded in the
popular mind, and not without its advocates among professional
astronomers, that the planets are inhabited by living and intelligent
beings, and it seems proper at the close of this chapter to inquire
briefly how far the facts and principles here developed are consistent
with this belief, and what support, if any, they lend to it.

At the outset we must observe that the word life is an elastic term,
hard to define in any satisfactory way, and yet standing for something
which we know here upon the earth. It is this idea, our familiar though
crude knowledge of life, which lies at the root of the matter. Life, if
it exists in another planet, must be in its essential character like
life upon the earth, and must at least possess those features which are
common to all forms of terrestrial life. It is an abuse of language to
say that life in Mars may be utterly unlike life in the earth; if it is
absolutely unlike, it is not life, whatever else it may be. Now, every
form of life found upon the earth has for its physical basis a certain
chemical compound, called protoplasm, which can exist and perpetuate
itself only within a narrow range of temperature, roughly speaking,
between 0° and 100° centigrade, although these limits can be
considerably overstepped for short periods of time. Moreover, this
protoplasm can be active only in the presence of water, or water vapor,
and we may therefore establish as the necessary conditions for the
continued existence and reproduction of life in any place that its
temperature must not be permanently above 100° or below 0°, C., and
water must be present in that place in some form.

With these conditions before us it is plain that life can not exist in
the sun on account of its high temperature. It is conceivable that
active and intelligent beings, salamanders, might exist there, but they
could not properly be said to live. In Jupiter and Saturn the same
condition of high temperature prevails, and probably also in Uranus and
Neptune, so that it seems highly improbable that any of these planets
should be the home of life.

Of the inner planets, Mercury and the moon seem destitute of any
considerable atmospheres, and are therefore lacking in the supply of
water necessary for life, and the same is almost certainly true of all
the asteroids. There remain Venus, Mars, and the satellites of the outer
planets, which latter, however, we must drop from consideration as being
too little known. On Venus there is an atmosphere probably containing
vapor of water, and it is well within the range of possibility that
liquid water should exist upon the surface of this planet and that its
temperature should fall within the prescribed limits. It would, however,
be straining our actual knowledge to affirm that such is the case, or to
insist that if such were the case, life would necessarily exist upon the
planet.

On Mars we encounter the fundamental difficulty of temperature already
noted in § 152. If in some unknown way the temperature is maintained
sufficiently high for the polar caps to be real snow, thawing and
forming again with the progress of the seasons, the necessary conditions
of life would seem to be fulfilled here and life if once introduced upon
the planet might abide and flourish. But of positive proof that such is
the case we have none.

On the whole, our survey lends little encouragement to the belief in
planetary life, for aside from the earth, of all the hundreds of bodies
in the solar system, not one is found in which the necessary conditions
of life are certainly fulfilled, and only two exist in which there is a
reasonable probability that these conditions may be satisfied.




CHAPTER XII

COMETS AND METEORS


158. VISITORS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.--All of the objects--sun, moon,
planets, stars--which we have thus far had to consider, are permanent
citizens of the sky, and we have no reason to suppose that their present
appearance differs appreciably from what it was 1,000 years or 10,000
years ago. But there is another class of objects--comets, meteors--which
appear unexpectedly, are visible for a time, and then vanish and are
seen no more. On account of this temporary character the astronomers of
ancient and mediæval times for the most part refused to regard them as
celestial bodies but classed them along with clouds, fogs,
Jack-o'-lanterns, and fireflies, as exhalations from the swamps or the
volcano; admitting them to be indeed important as harbingers of evil to
mankind, but having no especial significance for the astronomer.

The comet of 1618 A. D. inspired the lines--

    "Eight things there be a Comet brings,
      When it on high doth horrid range:
    Wind, Famine, Plague, and Death to Kings,
      War, Earthquakes, Floods, and Direful Change,"

which, according to White (History of the Doctrine of Comets), were to
be taught in all seriousness to peasants and school children.

It was by slow degrees, and only after direct measurements of parallax
had shown some of them to be more distant than the moon, that the tide
of old opinion was turned and comets were transferred from the sublunary
to the celestial sphere, and in more recent times meteors also have
been recognized as coming to us from outside the earth. A meteor, or
shooting star as it is often called, is one of the commonest of
phenomena, and one can hardly watch the sky for an hour on any clear and
moonless night without seeing several of those quick flashes of light
which look as if some star had suddenly left its place, dashed swiftly
across a portion of the sky and then vanished. It is this misleading
appearance that probably is responsible for the name shooting star.

[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Donati's comet.--BOND.]

159. COMETS.--Comets are less common and much longer-lived than meteors,
lasting usually for several weeks, and may be visible night after night
for many months, but never for many years, at a time. During the last
decade there is no year in which less than three comets have appeared,
and 1898 is distinguished by the discovery of ten of these bodies, the
largest number ever found in one year. On the average, we may expect a
new comet to be found about once in every ten weeks, but for the most
part they are small affairs, visible only in the telescope, and a fine
large one, like Donati's comet of 1858 (Fig. 101), or the Great Comet of
September, 1882, which was visible in broad daylight close beside the
sun, is a rare spectacle, and as striking and impressive as it is rare.

[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Some famous comets.]

Note in Fig. 102 the great variety of aspect presented by some of the
more famous comets, which are here represented upon a very small scale.

Fig. 103 is from a photograph of one of the faint comets of the year
1893, which appears here as a rather feeble streak of light amid the
stars which are scattered over the background of the picture. An
apparently detached portion of this comet is shown at the extreme left
of the picture, looking almost like another independent comet. The
clean, straight line running diagonally across the picture is the flash
of a bright meteor that chanced to pass within the range of the camera
while the comet was being photographed.

A more striking representation of a moderately bright telescopic comet
is contained in Figs. 104 and 105, which present two different views of
the same comet, showing a considerable change in its appearance. A
striking feature of Fig. 105 is the star images, which are here drawn
out into short lines all parallel with each other. During the exposure
of 2h. 20m. required to imprint this picture upon the photographic
plate, the comet was continually changing its position among the stars
on account of its orbital motion, and the plate was therefore moved
from time to time, so as to follow the comet and make its image always
fall at the same place. Hence the plate was continually shifted relative
to the stars whose images, drawn out into lines, show the direction in
which the plate was moved--i. e., the direction in which the comet was
moving across the sky. The same effect is shown in the other
photographs, but less conspicuously than here on account of their
shorter exposure times.

These pictures all show that one end of the comet is brighter and
apparently more dense than the other, and it is customary to call this
bright part the _head_ of the comet, while the brushlike appendage that
streams away from it is called the comet's _tail_.

[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Brooks's comet, November 13, 1893. BARNARD.]

160. THE PARTS OF A COMET.--It is not every comet that has a tail,
though all the large ones do, and in Fig. 103 the detached piece of
cometary matter at the left of the picture represents very well the
appearance of a tailless comet, a rather large but not very bright star
of a fuzzy or hairy appearance. The word comet means long-haired or
hairy star. Something of this vagueness of outline is found in all
comets, whose exact boundaries are hard to define, instead of being
sharp and clean-cut like those of a planet or satellite. Often,
however, there is found in the head of a comet a much more solid
appearing part, like the round white ball at the center of Fig. 106,
which is called the nucleus of the comet, and appears to be in some sort
the center from which its activities radiate. As shown in Figs. 106 and
107, the nucleus is sometimes surrounded by what are called envelopes,
which have the appearance of successive wrappings or halos placed about
it, and odd, spurlike projections, called jets, are sometimes found in
connection with the envelopes or in place of them. These figures also
show what is quite a common characteristic of large comets, a dark
streak running down the axis of the tail, showing that the tail is
hollow, a mere shell surrounding empty space.

[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Swift's comet, April 17, 1892.--BARNARD.]

The amount of detail shown in Figs. 106 and 107 is, however, quite
exceptional, and the ordinary comet is much more like Fig. 103 or 104.
Even a great comet when it first appears is not unlike the detached
fragment in Fig. 103, a faint and roundish patch of foggy light which
grows through successive stages to its maximum estate, developing a
tail, nucleus, envelopes, etc., only to lose them again as it shrinks
and finally disappears.

[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Swift's comet, April 24, 1892.--BARNARD.]

161. THE ORBITS OF COMETS.--It will be remembered that Newton found, as
a theoretical consequence of the law of gravitation, that a body moving
under the influence of the sun's attraction might have as its orbit any
one of the conic sections, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola, and among
the 400 and more comet orbits which have been determined every one of
these orbit forms appears, but curiously enough there is not a hyperbola
among them which, if drawn upon paper, could be distinguished by the
unaided eye from a parabola, and the ellipses are all so long and
narrow, not one of them being so nearly round as is the most eccentric
planet orbit, that astronomers are accustomed to look upon the parabola
as being the normal type of comet orbit, and to regard a comet whose
motion differs much from a parabola as being abnormal and calling for
some special explanation.

The fact that comet orbits are parabolas, or differ but little from
them, explains at once the temporary character and speedy disappearance
of these bodies. They are visitors to the solar system and visible for
only a short time, because the parabola in which they travel is not a
closed curve, and the comet, having passed once along that portion of it
near the earth and the sun, moves off along a path which ever thereafter
takes it farther and farther away, beyond the limit of visibility. The
development of the comet during the time it is visible, the growth and
disappearance of tail, nucleus, etc., depend upon its changing distance
from the sun, the highest development and most complex structure being
presented when it is nearest to the sun.

[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Head of Coggia's comet, July 13,
1874.--TROUVELOT.]

Fig. 108 shows the path of the Great Comet of 1882 during the period in
which it was seen, from September 3, 1882, to May 26, 1883. These
dates--IX, 3, and V, 26--are marked in the figure opposite the parts of
the orbit in which the comet stood at those times. Similarly, the
positions of the earth in its orbit at the beginning of September,
October, November, etc., are marked by the Roman numerals IX, X, XI,
etc. The line _S V_ shows the direction from the sun to the vernal
equinox, and _S_ Ω is the line along which the plane of the
comet's orbit intersects the plane of the earth's orbit--i. e., it is
the line of nodes of the comet orbit. Since the comet approached the sun
from the south side of the ecliptic, all of its orbit, save the little
segment which falls to the left of _S_ Ω, lies below (south) of
the plane of the earth's orbit, and the part which would be hidden if
this plane were opaque is represented by a broken line.

[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Head of Donati's comet, September 30, October
2, 1858.--BOND.]

162. ELEMENTS OF A COMET'S ORBIT.--There is a theorem of geometry to the
effect that through any three points not in the same straight line one
circle, and only one, can be drawn. Corresponding to this there is a
theorem of celestial mechanics, that through any three positions of a
comet one conic section, and only one, can be passed along which the
comet can move in accordance with the law of gravitation. This conic
section is, of course, its orbit, and at the discovery of a comet
astronomers always hasten to observe its position in the sky on
different nights in order to obtain the three positions (right
ascensions and declinations) necessary for determining the particular
orbit in which it moves. The circle, to which reference was made above,
is completely ascertained and defined when we know its radius and the
position of its center. A parabola is not so simply defined, and five
numbers, called the _elements_ of its orbit, are required to fix
accurately a comet's path around the sun. Two of these relate to the
position of the line of nodes and the angle which the orbit plane makes
with the plane of the ecliptic; a third fixes the direction of the axis
of the orbit in its plane, and the remaining two, which are of more
interest to us, are the date at which the comet makes its nearest
approach to the sun (_perihelion passage_) and its distance from the sun
at that date (_perihelion distance_). The date, September 17th, placed
near the center of Fig. 108, is the former of these elements, while the
latter, which is too small to be accurately measured here, may be found
from Fig. 109 to be 0.82 of the sun's diameter, or, in terms of the
earth's distance from the sun, 0.008.

[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Orbits of the earth and the Great Comet of
1882.]

Fig. 109 shows on a large scale the shape of that part of the orbit near
the sun and gives the successive positions of the comet, at intervals of
2/10 of a day, on September 16th and 17th, showing that in less than 10
hours--17.0 to 17.4--the comet swung around the sun through an angle of
more than 240°. When at its perihelion it was moving with a velocity of
300 miles per second! This very unusual velocity was due to the comet's
extraordinarily close approach to the sun. The earth's velocity in its
orbit is only 19 miles per second, and the velocity of any comet at any
distance from the sun, provided its orbit is a parabola, may be found
by dividing this number by the square root of half the comet's
distance--e. g., 300 miles per second equals 19 ÷ √ 0.004.

[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Motion of the Great Comet of 1883 in passing
around the sun.]

Most of the visible comets have their perihelion distances included
between 1/3 and 4/3 of the earth's distance from the sun, but
occasionally one is found, like the second comet of 1885, whose nearest
approach to the sun lies far outside the earth's orbit, in this case
halfway out to the orbit of Jupiter; but such a comet must be a very
large one in order to be seen at all from the earth. There is, however,
some reason for believing that the number of comets which move around
the sun without ever coming inside the orbit of Jupiter, or even that of
Saturn, is much larger than the number of those which come close enough
to be discovered from the earth. In any case we are reminded of Kepler's
saying, that comets in the sky are as plentiful as fishes in the sea,
which seems to be very little exaggerated when we consider that,
according to Kleiber, out of all the comets which enter the solar system
probably not more than 2 or 3 per cent are ever discovered.

[Illustration: FIG. 110.--The Great Comet of 1843.]

163. DIMENSIONS OF COMETS.--The comet whose orbit is shown in Figs. 108
and 109 is the finest and largest that has appeared in recent years. Its
tail, which at its maximum extent would have more than bridged the space
between sun and earth (100,000,000 miles), is made very much too short
in Fig. 109, but when at its best was probably not inferior to that of
the Great Comet of 1843, shown in Fig. 110. As we shall see later,
there is a peculiar and special relationship between these two comets.

The head of the comet of 1882 was not especially large--about twice the
diameter of the ball of Saturn--but its nucleus, according to an
estimate made by Dr. Elkin when it was very near perihelion, was as
large as the moon. The head of the comet shown in Fig. 107 was too large
to be put in the space between the earth and the moon, and the Great
Comet of 1811 had a head considerably larger than the sun itself. From
these colossal sizes down to the smallest shred just visible in the
telescope, comets of all dimensions may be found, but the smaller the
comet the less the chance of its being discovered, and a comet as small
as the earth would probably go unobserved unless it approached very
close to us.

164. THE MASS OF A COMET.--There is no known case in which the mass of a
comet has ever been measured, yet nothing about them is more sure than
that they are bodies with mass which is attracted by the sun and the
planets, and which in its turn attracts both sun and planets and
produces perturbations in their motion. These perturbations are,
however, too small to be measured, although the corresponding
perturbations in the comet's motion are sometimes enormous, and since
these mutual perturbations are proportional to the masses of comet and
planet, we are forced to say that, by comparison with even such small
bodies as the moon or Mercury, the mass of a comet is utterly
insignificant, certainly not as great as a ten-thousandth part of the
mass of the earth. In the case of the Great Comet of 1882, if we leave
its hundred million miles of tail out of account and suppose the entire
mass condensed into its head, we find by a little computation that the
average density of the head under these circumstances must have been
less than 1/1500 of the density of air. In ordinary laboratory practice
this would be called a pretty good vacuum. A striking observation made
on September 17, 1882, goes to confirm the very small density of this
comet. It is shown in Fig. 109 that early on that day the comet crossed
the line joining earth and sun, and therefore passed in transit over the
sun's disk. Two observers at the Cape of Good Hope saw the comet
approach the sun, and followed it with their telescopes until the
nucleus actually reached the edge of the sun and disappeared, behind it
as they supposed, for no trace of the comet, not even its nucleus, could
be seen against the sun, although it was carefully looked for. Now, the
figure shows that the comet passed between the earth and sun, and its
densest parts were therefore too attenuated to cut off any perceptible
fraction of the sun's rays. In other cases stars have been seen through
the head of a comet, shining apparently with undimmed luster, although
in some cases they seem to have been slightly refracted out of their
true positions.

165. METEORS.--Before proceeding further with the study of comets it is
well to turn aside and consider their humbler relatives, the shooting
stars. On some clear evening, when the moon is absent from the sky,
watch the heavens for an hour and count the meteors visible during that
time. Note their paths, the part of the sky where they appear and where
they disappear, their brightness, and whether they all move with equal
swiftness. Out of such simple observations with the unaided eye there
has grown a large and important branch of astronomical science, some
parts of which we shall briefly summarize here.

A particular meteor is a local phenomenon seen over only a small part of
the earth's surface, although occasionally a very big and bright one may
travel and be visible over a considerable territory. Such a one in
December, 1876, swept over the United States from Kansas to
Pennsylvania, and was seen from eleven different States. But the
ordinary shooting star is much less conspicuous, and, as we know from
simultaneous observations made at neighboring places, it makes its
appearance at a height of some 75 miles above the earth's surface,
occupies something like a second in moving over its path, and then
disappears at a height of about 50 miles or more, although occasionally
a big one comes down to the very surface of the earth with force
sufficient to bury itself in the ground, from which it may be dug up,
handled, weighed, and turned over to the chemist to be analyzed. The
pieces thus found show that the big meteors, at least, are masses of
stone or mineral; iron is quite commonly found in them, as are a
considerable number of other terrestrial substances combined in rather
peculiar ways. But no chemical element not found on the earth has ever
been discovered in a meteor.

166. NATURE OF METEORS.--The swiftness with which the meteors sweep down
shows that they must come from outside the earth, for even half their
velocity, if given to them by some terrestrial volcano or other
explosive agent, would send them completely away from the earth never to
return. We must therefore look upon them as so many projectiles,
bullets, fired against the earth from some outside source and arrested
in their motion by the earth's atmosphere, which serves as a cushion to
protect the ground from the bombardment which would otherwise prove in
the highest degree dangerous to both property and life. The speed of the
meteor is checked by the resistance which the atmosphere offers to its
motion, and the energy represented by that speed is transformed into
heat, which in less than a second raises the meteor and the surrounding
air to incandescence, melts the meteor either wholly or in part, and
usually destroys its identity, leaving only an impalpable dust, which
cools off as it settles slowly through the lower atmosphere to the
ground. The heating effect of the air's resistance is proportional to
the square of the meteor's velocity, and even at such a moderate speed
as 1 mile per second the effect upon the meteor is the same as if it
stood still in a bath of red-hot air. Now, the actual velocity of
meteors through the air is often 30 or 40 times as great as this, and
the corresponding effect of the air in raising its temperature is more
than 1,000 times that of red heat. Small wonder that the meteor is
brought to lively incandescence and consumed even in a fraction of a
second.

167. THE NUMBER OF METEORS.--A single observer may expect to see in the
evening hours about one meteor every 10 minutes on the average,
although, of course, in this respect much irregularity may occur. Later
in the night they become more frequent, and after 2 A. M. there are
about three times as many to be seen as in the evening hours. But no one
person can keep a watch upon the whole sky, high and low, in front and
behind, and experience shows that by increasing the number of observers
and assigning to each a particular part of the sky, the total number of
meteors counted may be increased about five-fold. So, too, the observers
at any one place can keep an effective watch upon only those meteors
which come into the earth's atmosphere within some moderate distance of
their station, say 50 or 100 miles, and to watch every part of that
atmosphere would require a large number of stations, estimated at
something more than 10,000, scattered systematically over the whole face
of the earth. If we piece together the several numbers above considered,
taking 14 as a fair average of the hourly number of meteors to be seen
by a single observer at all hours of the night, we shall find for
the total number of meteors encountered by the earth in 24 hours,
14 × 5 × 10,000 × 24 = 16,800,000. Without laying too much stress upon
this particular number, we may fairly say that the meteors picked up by
the earth every day are to be reckoned by millions, and since they come
at all seasons of the year, we shall have to admit that the region
through which the earth moves, instead of being empty space, is really a
dust cloud, each individual particle of dust being a prospective meteor.

On the average these individual particles are very small and very far
apart; a cloud of silver dimes each about 250 miles from its nearest
neighbor is perhaps a fair representation of their average mass and
distance from each other, but, of course, great variations are to be
expected both in the size and in the frequency of the particles. There
must be great numbers of them that are too small to make shooting stars
visible to the naked eye, and such are occasionally seen darting by
chance across the field of view of a telescope.

168. THE ZODIACAL LIGHT is an effect probably due to the reflection of
sunlight from the myriads of these tiny meteors which occupy the space
inside the earth's orbit. It is a faint and diffuse stream of light,
something like the Milky Way, which may be seen in the early evening or
morning stretching up from the sunrise or sunset point of the horizon
along the ecliptic and following its course for many degrees, possibly
around the entire circumference of the sky. It may be seen at any season
of the year, although it shows to the best advantage in spring evenings
and autumn mornings. Look for it.

169. GREAT METEORS.--But there are other meteors, veritable fireballs in
appearance, far more conspicuous and imposing than the ordinary shooting
star. Such a one exploded over the city of Madrid, Spain, on the morning
of February 10, 1896, giving in broad sunlight "a brilliant flash which
was followed ninety seconds later by a succession of terrific noises
like the discharge of a battery of artillery." Fig. 111 shows a large
meteor which was seen in California in the early evening of July 27,
1894, and which left behind it a luminous trail or cloud visible for
more than half an hour.

Not infrequently large meteors are found traveling together, two or
three or more in company, making their appearance simultaneously as did
the California meteor of October 22, 1896, which is described as triple,
the trio following one another like a train of cars, and Arago cites an
instance, from the year 1830, where within a short space of time some
forty brilliant meteors crossed the sky, all moving in the same
direction with a whistling noise and displaying in their flight all the
colors of the rainbow.

The mass of great meteors such as these must be measured in hundreds if
not thousands of pounds, and stories are current, although not very well
authenticated, of even larger ones, many tons in weight, having been
found partially buried in the ground. Of meteors which have been
actually seen to fall from the sky, the largest single fragment
recovered weighs about 500 pounds, but it is only a fragment of the
original meteor, which must have been much more massive before it was
broken up by collision with the atmosphere.

[Illustration: FIG. 111.--The California meteor of July 27, 1894.]

170. THE VELOCITY OF METEORS.--Every meteor, big or little, is subject
to the law of gravitation, and before it encounters the earth must be
moving in some kind of orbit having the sun at its focus, the particular
species of orbit--ellipse, parabola, hyperbola--depending upon the
velocity and direction of its motion. Now, the direction in which a
meteor is moving can be determined without serious difficulty from
observations of its apparent path across the sky made by two or more
observers, but the velocity can not be so readily found, since the
meteors go too fast for any ordinary process of timing. But by
photographing one of them two or three times on the same plate, with an
interval of only a tenth of a second between exposures, Dr. Elkin has
succeeded in showing, in a few cases, that their velocities varied from
20 to 25 miles per second, and must have been considerably greater than
this before the meteors encountered the earth's atmosphere. This is a
greater velocity than that of the earth in its orbit, 19 miles per
second, as might have been anticipated, since the mere fact that meteors
can be seen at all in the evening hours shows that some of them at least
must travel considerably faster than the earth, for, counting in the
direction of the earth's motion, the region of sunset and evening is
always on the rear side of the earth, and meteors in order to strike
this region must overtake it by their swifter motion. We have here, in
fact, the reason why meteors are especially abundant in the morning
hours; at this time the observer is on the front side of the earth which
catches swift and slow meteors alike, while the rear is pelted only by
the swifter ones which follow it.

A comparison of the relative number of morning and evening meteors makes
it probable that the average meteor moves, relative to the sun, with a
velocity of about 26 miles per second, which is very approximately the
average velocity of comets when they are at the earth's distance from
the sun. Astronomers, therefore, consider meteors as well as comets to
have the parabola and the elongated ellipse as their characteristic
orbits.

171. METEOR SHOWERS--THE RADIANT.--There is evident among meteors a
distinct tendency for individuals, to the number of hundreds or even
hundreds of millions, to travel together in flocks or swarms, all going
the same way in orbits almost exactly alike. This gregarious tendency is
made manifest not only by the fact that from time to time there are
unusually abundant meteoric displays, but also by a striking peculiarity
of their behavior at such times. The meteors all seem to come from a
particular part of the heavens, as if here were a hole in the sky
through which they were introduced, and from which they flow away in
every direction, even those which do not visibly start from this place
having paths among the stars which, if prolonged backward, would pass
through it. The cause of this appearance may be understood from Fig.
112, which represents a group of meteors moving together along parallel
paths toward an observer at _D_. Traveling unseen above the earth until
they encounter the upper strata of its atmosphere, they here become
incandescent and speed on in parallel paths, _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, _5_,
_6_, which, as seen by the observer, are projected back against the sky
into luminous streaks that, as is shown by the arrowheads, _b_, _c_,
_d_, all seem to radiate from the point _a_--i. e., from the point in
the sky whose direction from the observer is parallel to the paths of
the meteors.

[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Explanation of the radiant of a meteoric
shower.--DENNING.]

Such a display is called a meteor shower, and the point _a_ is called
its radiant. Note how those meteors which appear near the radiant all
have short paths, while those remote from it in the sky have longer
ones. Query: As the night wears on and the stars shift toward the west,
will the radiant share in their motion or will it be left behind? Would
the luminous part of the path of any of these meteors pass across the
radiant from one side to the other? Is such a crossing of the radiant
possible under any circumstances? Fig. 113 shows how the meteor paths
are grouped around the radiant of a strongly marked shower. Select from
it the meteors which do not belong to this shower.

[Illustration: FIG. 113.--The radiant of a meteoric shower, showing
also the paths of three meteors which do not belong to this
shower.--DENNING.]

Many hundreds of these radiants have been observed in the sky, each of
which represents an orbit along which a group of meteors moves, and the
relation of one of these orbits to that of the earth is shown in Fig.
114. The orbit of the meteors is an ellipse extending out beyond the
orbit of Uranus, but so eccentric that a part of it comes inside the
orbit of the earth, and the figure shows only that part of it which lies
nearest the sun. The Roman numerals which are placed along the earth's
orbit show the position of the earth at the beginning of the tenth
month, eleventh month, etc. The meteors flow along their orbit in a long
procession, whose direction of motion is indicated by the arrow heads,
and the earth, coming in the opposite direction, plunges into this
stream and receives the meteor shower when it reaches the intersection
of the two orbits. The long arrow at the left of the figure represents
the direction of motion of another meteor shower which encounters the
earth at this point.

[Illustration: FIG. 114.--The orbits of the earth and the November
meteors.]

Can you determine from the figure answers to the following questions? On
what day of the year will the earth meet each of these showers? Will the
radiant points of the showers lie above or below the plane of the
earth's orbit? Will these meteors strike the front or the rear of the
earth? Can they be seen in the evening hours?

From many of the radiants year after year, upon the same day or week in
each year, there comes a swarm of shooting stars, showing that there
must be a continuous procession of meteors moving along this orbit, so
that some are always ready to strike the earth whenever it reaches the
intersection of its orbit with theirs. Such is the explanation of the
shower which appears each year in the first half of August, and whose
meteors are sometimes called Perseids, because their radiant lies in the
constellation Perseus, and a similar explanation holds for all the star
showers which are repeated year after year.

172. THE LEONIDS.--There is, however, a kind of star shower, of which
the Leonids (radiant in Leo) is the most conspicuous type, in which the
shower, although repeated from year to year, is much more striking in
some years than in others. Thus, to quote from the historian: "In 1833
the shower was well observed along the whole eastern coast of North
America from the Gulf of Mexico to Halifax. The meteors were most
numerous at about 5 A. M. on November 13th, and the rising sun could not
blot out all traces of the phenomena, for large meteors were seen now
and then in full daylight. Within the scope that the eye could contain,
more than twenty could be seen at a time shooting in every direction.
Not a cloud obscured the broad expanse, and millions of meteors sped
their way across in every point of the compass. Their coruscations were
bright, gleaming, and incessant, and they fell thick as the flakes in
the early snows of December." But, so far as is known, none of them
reached the ground. An illiterate man on the following day remarked:
"The stars continued to fall until none were left. I am anxious to see
how the heavens will appear this evening, for I believe we shall see no
more stars."

An eyewitness in the Southern States thus describes the effect of this
shower upon the plantation negroes: "Upward of a hundred lay prostrate
upon the ground, some speechless and some with the bitterest cries, but
with their hands upraised, imploring God to save the world and them. The
scene was truly awful, for never did rain fall much thicker than the
meteors fell toward the earth--east, west, north, and south it was the
same." In the preceding year a similar but feebler shower from the same
radiant created much alarm in France, and through the old historic
records its repetitions may be traced back at intervals of 33 or 34
years, although with many interruptions, to October 12, 902, O. S., when
"an immense number of falling stars were seen to spread themselves over
the face of the sky like rain."

Such a star shower differs from the one repeated every year chiefly in
the fact that its meteors, instead of being drawn out into a long
procession, are mainly clustered in a single flock which may be long
enough to require two or three or four years to pass a given point of
its orbit, but which is far from extending entirely around it, so that
meteors from this source are abundant only in those years in which the
flock is at or near the intersection of its orbit with that of the
earth. The fact that the Leonid shower is repeated at intervals of 33 or
34 years (it appeared in 1799, 1832-'33, 1866-'67) shows that this is
the "periodic time" in its orbit, which latter must of course be an
ellipse, and presumably a long and narrow one. It is this orbit which is
shown in Fig. 114, and the student should note in this figure that if
the meteor stream at the point where it cuts through the plane of the
earth's orbit were either nearer to or farther from the sun than is the
earth there could be no shower; the earth and the meteors would pass by
without a collision. Now, the meteors in their motion are subject to
perturbations, particularly by the large planets Jupiter, Saturn, and
Uranus, which slightly change the meteor orbit, and it seems certain
that the changes thus produced will sometimes thrust the swarm inside or
outside the orbit of the earth, and thus cause a failure of the shower
at times when it is expected. The meteors were due at the crossing of
the orbits in November, 1899 and 1900, and, although a few were then
seen, the shower was far from being a brilliant one, and its failure was
doubtless caused by the outer planets, which switched the meteors aside
from the path in which they had been moving for a century. Whether they
will be again switched back so as to produce future showers is at the
present time uncertain.

173. CAPTURE OF THE LEONIDS.--But a far more striking effect of
perturbations is to be found in Fig. 115, which shows the relation of
the Leonid orbit to those of the principal planets, and illustrates a
curious chapter in the history of the meteor swarm that has been worked
out by mathematical analysis, and is probably a pretty good account of
what actually befell them. Early in the second century of the Christian
era this flock of meteors came down toward the sun from outer space,
moving along a parabolic orbit which would have carried it just inside
the orbit of Jupiter, and then have sent it off to return no more. But
such was not to be its fate. As it approached the orbit of Uranus, in
the year 126 A. D., that planet chanced to be very near at hand and
perturbed the motion of the meteors to such an extent that the character
of their orbit was completely changed into the ellipse shown in the
figure, and in this new orbit they have moved from that time to this,
permanent instead of transient members of the solar system. The
perturbations, however, did not end with the year in which the meteors
were captured and annexed to the solar system, but ever since that time
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have been pulling together upon the orbit,
and have gradually turned it around into its present position as shown
in the figure, and it is chiefly this shifting of the orbit's position
in the thousand years that have elapsed since 902 A. D. that makes the
meteor shower now come in November instead of in October as it did
then.

[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Supposed capture of the November meteors by
Uranus.]

174. BREAKING UP A METEOR SWARM.--How closely packed together these
meteors were at the time of their annexation to the solar system is
unknown, but it is certain that ever since that time the sun has been
exerting upon them a tidal influence tending to break up the swarm and
distribute its particles around the orbit, as the Perseids are
distributed, and, given sufficient time, it will accomplish this, but up
to the present the work is only partly done. A certain number of the
meteors have gained so much over the slower moving ones as to have made
an extra circuit of the orbit and overtaken the rear of the procession,
so that there is a thin stream of them extending entirely around the
orbit and furnishing in every November a Leonid shower; but by far the
larger part of the meteors still cling together, although drawn out into
a stream or ribbon, which, though very thin, is so long that it takes
some three years to pass through the perihelion of its orbit. It is only
when the earth plunges through this ribbon, as it should in 1899, 1900,
1901, that brilliant Leonid showers can be expected.

175. RELATION OF COMETS AND METEORS.--It appears from the foregoing that
meteors and comets move in similar orbits, and we have now to push the
analogy a little further and note that in some instances at least they
move in identically the same orbit, or at least in orbits so like that
an appreciable difference between them is hardly to be found. Thus a
comet which was discovered and observed early in the year 1866, moves in
the same orbit with the Leonid meteors, passing its perihelion about ten
months ahead of the main body of the meteors. If it were set back in its
orbit by ten months' motion, _it would be a part of the meteor swarm_.
Similarly, the Perseid meteors have a comet moving in their orbit
actually immersed in the stream of meteor particles, and several other
of the more conspicuous star showers have comets attending them.

Perhaps the most remarkable case of this character is that of a shower
which comes in the latter part of November from the constellation
Andromeda, and which from its association with the comet called Biela
(after the name of its discoverer) is frequently referred to as the
Bielid shower. This comet, an inconspicuous one moving in an unusually
small elliptical orbit, had been observed at various times from 1772
down to 1846 without presenting anything remarkable in its appearance;
but about the beginning of the latter year, with very little warning, it
broke in two, and for three months the pieces were watched by
astronomers moving off, side by side, something more than half as far
apart as are the earth and moon. It disappeared, made the circuit of its
orbit, and six years later came back, with the fragments nearly ten
times as far apart as before, and after a short stay near the earth once
more disappeared in the distance, never to be seen again, although the
fragments should have returned to perihelion at least half a dozen times
since then. In one respect the orbit of the comet was remarkable: it
passed through the place in which the earth stands on November 27th of
each year, so that if the comet were at that particular part of its
orbit on any November 27th, a collision between it and the earth would
be inevitable. So far as is known, no such collision with the comet has
ever occurred, but the Bielid meteors which are strung along its orbit
do encounter the earth on that date, in greater or less abundance in
different years, and are watched with much interest by the astronomers
who look upon them as the final appearance of the _débris_ of a worn-out
comet.

176. PERIODIC COMETS.--The Biela comet is a specimen of the type which
astronomers call periodic comets--i. e., those which move in small
ellipses and have correspondingly short periodic times, so that they
return frequently and regularly to perihelion. The comets which
accompany the other meteor swarms--Leonids, Perseids, etc.--also belong
to this class as do some 30 or 40 others which have periodic times less
than a century. As has been already indicated, these deviations from the
normal parabolic orbit call for some special explanation, and the
substance of that explanation is contained in the account of the Leonid
meteors and their capture by Uranus. Any comet may be thus captured by
the attraction of a planet near which it passes. It is only necessary
that the perturbing action of the planet should result in a diminution
of the comet's velocity, for we have already learned that it is this
velocity which determines the character of the orbit, and anything less
than the velocity appropriate to a parabola must produce an
ellipse--i. e., a closed orbit around which the body will revolve time
after time in endless succession. We note in Fig. 115 that when the
Leonid swarm encountered Uranus it passed _in front of_ the planet and
had its velocity diminished and its orbit changed into an ellipse
thereby. It might have passed behind Uranus, it would have passed behind
had it come a little later, and the effect would then have been just the
opposite. Its velocity would have been increased, its orbit changed to a
hyperbola, and it would have left the solar system more rapidly than it
came into it, thrust out instead of held in by the disturbing planet. Of
such cases we can expect no record to remain, but the captured comet is
its own witness to what has happened, and bears imprinted upon its orbit
the brand of the planet which slowed down its motion. Thus in Fig. 115
the changed orbit of the meteors has its _aphelion_ (part remotest from
the sun) quite close to the orbit of Uranus, and one of its nodes, ℧,
the point in which it cuts through the plane of the ecliptic from north
to south side, is also very near to the same orbit. It is these two
marks, aphelion and node, which by their position identify Uranus as the
planet instrumental in capturing the meteor swarm, and the date of the
capture is found by working back with their respective periodic times to
an epoch at which planet and comet were simultaneously near this node.

Jupiter, by reason of his great mass, is an especially efficient
capturer of comets, and Fig. 116 shows his group of captives, his
family of comets as they are sometimes called. The several orbits are
marked with the names commonly given to the comets. Frequently this is
the name of their discoverer, but often a different system is
followed--e. g., the name 1886, IV, means the fourth comet to pass
through perihelion in the year 1886. The other great planets--Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune--have also their families of captured comets, and
according to Schulhof, who does not entirely agree with the common
opinion about captured comets, the earth has caught no less than nine of
these bodies.

[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Jupiter's family of comets.]

177. COMET GROUPS.--But there is another kind of comet family, or comet
group as it is called, which deserves some notice, and which is best
exemplified by the Great Comet of 1882 and its relatives. No less than
four other comets are known to be traveling in substantially the same
orbit with this one, the group consisting of comets 1668, I; 1843, I;
1880, I; 1882, II; 1887, I. The orbit itself is not quite a parabola,
but a very elongated ellipse, whose major axis and corresponding
periodic time can not be very accurately determined from the available
data, but it certainly extends far beyond the orbit of Neptune, and
requires not less than 500 years for the comet to complete a revolution
in it. It was for a time supposed that some one of the recent comets of
this group of five might be a return of the comet of 1668 brought back
ahead of time by unknown perturbations. There is still a possibility of
this, but it is quite out of the question to suppose that the last four
members of the group are anything other than separate and distinct
comets moving in practically the same orbit. This common orbit suggests
a common origin for the comets, but leaves us to conjecture how they
became separated.

The observed orbits of these five comets present some slight
discordances among themselves, but if we suppose each comet to move in
the average of the observed paths it is a simple matter to fix their
several positions at the present time. They have all receded from the
sun nearly on line toward the bright star Sirius, and were all of them,
at the beginning of the year 1900, standing nearly motionless inside of
a space not bigger than the sun and distant from the sun about 150 radii
of the earth's orbit. The great rapidity with which they swept through
that part of their orbit near the sun (see § 162) is being compensated
by the present extreme slowness of their motions, so that the comets of
1668 and 1882, whose passages through the solar system were separated by
an interval of more than two centuries, now stand together near the
aphelion of their orbits, separated by a distance only 50 per cent
greater than the diameter of the moon's orbit, and they will continue
substantially in this position for some two or three centuries to come.

The slowness with which these bodies move when far from the sun is
strikingly illustrated by an equation of celestial mechanics which for
parabolic orbits takes the place of Kepler's Third Law--viz.:

    r^3 / T^2 = 178,

where _T_ is the time, in years, required for the comet to move from its
perihelion to any remote part of the orbit, whose distance from the sun
is represented, in radii of the earth's orbit, by _r_. If the comet of
1668 had moved in a parabola instead of the ellipse supposed above, how
many years would have been required to reach its present distance from
the sun?

178. RELATION OF COMETS TO THE SOLAR SYSTEM.--The orbits of these comets
illustrate a tendency which is becoming ever more strongly marked.
Because comet orbits are nearly parabolas, it used to be assumed that
they were exactly parabolic, and this carried with it the conclusion
that comets have their origin outside the solar system. It may be so,
and this view is in some degree supported by the fact that these nearly
parabolic orbits of both comets and meteors are tipped at all possible
angles to the plane of the ecliptic instead of lying near it as do the
orbits of the planets; and by the further fact that, unlike the planets,
the comets show no marked tendency to move around their orbits in the
direction in which the sun rotates upon his axis. There is, in fact, the
utmost confusion among them in this respect, some going one way and some
another. The law of the solar system (gravitation) is impressed upon
their movements, but its order is not.

But as observations grow more numerous and more precise, and comet
orbits are determined with increasing accuracy, there is a steady gain
in the number of elliptic orbits at the expense of the parabolic ones,
and if comets are of extraneous origin we must admit that a very
considerable percentage of them have their velocities slowed down
within the solar system, perhaps not so much by the attraction of the
planets as by the resistance offered to their motion by meteor particles
and swarms along their paths. A striking instance of what may befall a
comet in this way is shown in Fig. 117, where the tail of a comet
appears sadly distorted and broken by what is presumed to have been a
collision with a meteor swarm. A more famous case of impeded motion is
offered by the comet which bears the name of Encke. This has a periodic
time less than that of any other known comet, and at intervals of forty
months comes back to perihelion, each time moving in a little smaller
orbit than before, unquestionably on account of some resistance which it
has suffered.

[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Brooks's comet, October 21, 1893.--BARNARD.]

179. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMET.--We saw in § 174 that the sun's action
upon a meteor swarm tends to break it up into a long stream, and the
same tendency to break up is true of comets whose attenuated substance
presents scant resistance to this force. According to the mathematical
analysis of Roche, if the comet stood still the sun's tidal force would
tend first to draw it out on line with the sun, just as the earth's
tidal force pulled the moon out of shape (§ 42), and then it would cause
the lighter part of the comet's substance to flow away from both ends of
this long diameter. This destructive action of the sun is not limited to
comets and meteor streams, for it tends to tear the earth and moon to
pieces as well; but the densities and the resulting mutual attractions
of their parts are far too great to permit this to be accomplished.

As a curiosity of mathematical analysis we may note that a spherical
cloud of meteors, or dust particles weighing a gramme each, and placed
at the earth's distance from the sun, will be broken up and dissipated
by the sun's tidal action if the average distance between the particles
exceeds two yards. Now, the earth is far more dense than such a cloud,
whose extreme tenuity, however, suggests what we have already learned of
the small density of comets, and prepares us in their case for an
outflow of particles at both ends of the diameter directed toward the
sun. Something of this kind actually occurs, for the tail of a comet
streams out on the side opposite to the sun, and in general points away
from the sun, as is shown in Fig. 109, and the envelopes and jets rise
up toward the sun; but an inspection of Fig. 106 will show that the tail
and the envelope are too unlike to be produced by one and the same set
of forces.

It was long ago suggested that the sun possibly exerts upon a comet's
substance a repelling force in addition to the attracting force which we
call gravity. We think naturally in this connection of the repelling
force which a charge of electricity exerts upon a similar charge placed
on a neighboring body, and we note that if both sun and comet carried a
considerable store of electricity upon their surfaces this would furnish
just such a repelling force as seems indicated by the phenomena of
comets' tails; for the force of gravity would operate between the
substance of sun and comet, and on the whole would be the controlling
force, while the electric charges would produce a repulsion, relatively
feeble for the big particles and strong for the little ones, since an
electric charge lies wholly on the surface, while gravity permeates the
whole mass of a body, and the ratio of volume (gravity) to surface
(electric charge) increases rapidly with increasing size. The repelling
force would thrust back toward the comet those particles which flowed
out toward the sun, while it would urge forward those which flowed away
from it, thus producing the difference in appearance between tail and
envelopes, the latter being regarded from this standpoint as stunted
tails strongly curved backward. In recent years the Russian astronomer
Bredichin has made a careful study of the shape and positions of comets'
tails and finds that they fit with mathematical precision to the
theories of electric repulsion.

180. COMET TAILS.--According to Bredichin, a comet's tail is formed by
something like the following process: In the head of the comet itself a
certain part of its matter is broken up into fine bits, single molecules
perhaps, which, as they no longer cling together, may be described as in
the condition of vapor. By the repellent action of both sun and comet
these molecules are cast out from the head of the comet and stream away
in the direction opposite to the sun with different velocities, the
heavy ones slowly and the light ones faster, much as particles of smoke
stream away from a smokestack, making for the comet a tail which like a
trail of smoke is composed of constantly changing particles. The result
of this process is shown in Fig. 118, where the positions of the comet
in its orbit on successive days are marked by the Roman numerals, and
the broken lines represent the paths of molecules _m^{I}_, _m^{II}_,
_m^{III}_, etc., expelled from it on their several dates and traveling
thereafter in orbits determined by the combined effect of the sun's
attraction, the sun's repulsion, and the comet's repulsion. The comet's
attraction (gravity) is too small to be taken into account. The line
drawn upward from _VI_ represents the positions of these molecules on
the sixth day, and shows that all of them are arranged in a tail
pointing nearly away from the sun. A similar construction for the other
dates gives the corresponding positions of the tail, always pointing
away from the sun.

[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Formation of a comet's tail.]

Only the lightest kind of molecules--e. g., hydrogen--could drift away
from the comet so rapidly as is here shown. The heavier ones, such as
carbon and iron, would be repelled as strongly by the electric forces,
but they would be more strongly pulled back by the gravitative forces,
thus producing a much slower separation between them and the head of the
comet. Construct a figure such as the above, in which the molecules
shall recede from the comet only one eighth as fast as in Fig. 118, and
note what a different position it gives to the comet's tail. Instead of
pointing directly away from the sun, it will be bent strongly to one
side, as is the large plume-shaped tail of the Donati comet shown in
Fig. 101. But observe that this comet has also a nearly straight tail,
like the theoretical one of Fig. 118. We have here two distinct types of
comet tails, and according to Bredichin there is still another but
unusual type, even more strongly bent to one side of the line joining
comet and sun, and appearing quite short and stubby. The existence of
these three types, and their peculiarities of shape and position, are
all satisfactorily accounted for by the supposition that they are made
of different materials. The relative molecular weights of hydrogen, some
of the hydrocarbons, and iron, are such that tails composed of these
molecules would behave just as do the actual tails observed and
classified into these three types. The spectroscope shows that these
materials--hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and iron--are present in comets, and
leaves little room for doubt of the essential soundness of Bredichin's
theory.

181. DISINTEGRATION OF COMETS.--We must regard the tail as waste matter
cast off from the comet's head, and although the amount of this matter
is very small, it must in some measure diminish the comet's mass. This
process is, of course, most active at the time of perihelion passage,
and if the comet returns to perihelion time after time, as the periodic
ones which move in elliptic orbits must do, this waste of material may
become a serious matter, leading ultimately to the comet's destruction.
It is significant in this connection that the periodic comets are all
small and inconspicuous, not one of them showing a tail of any
considerable dimensions, and it appears probable that they are far
advanced along the road which, in the case of Biela's comet, led to its
disintegration. Their fragments are in part strewn through the solar
system, making some small fraction of its cloud of cosmic dust, and in
part they have been carried away from the sun and scattered throughout
the universe along hyperbolic orbits impressed upon them at the time
they left the comet.

But it is not through the tail only that the disintegrating process is
worked out. While Biela's comet is perhaps the most striking instance in
which the head has broken up, it is by no means the only one. The Great
Comet of 1882 cast off a considerable number of fragments which moved
away as independent though small comets and other more recent comets
have been seen to do the same. An even more striking phenomenon was the
gradual breaking up of the nucleus of the same comet, 1882, II, into a
half dozen nuclei arranged in line like beads upon a string, and
pointing along the axis of the tail. See Fig. 119, which shows the
series of changes observed in the head of this comet.

182. COMETS AND THE SPECTROSCOPE.--The spectrum presented by comets was
long a puzzle, and still retains something of that character, although
much progress has been made toward an understanding of it. In general it
consists of two quite distinct parts--first, a faint background of
continuous spectrum due to ordinary sunlight reflected from the comet;
and, second, superposed upon this, three bright bands like the carbon
band shown at the middle of Fig. 48, only not so sharply defined. These
bands make a discontinuous spectrum quite similar to that given off by
compounds of hydrogen and carbon, and of course indicate that a part of
the comet's light originates in the body itself, which must therefore be
incandescent, or at least must contain some incandescent portions.

[Illustration: FIG. 119.--The head of the Great Comet of
1882.--WINLOCK.]

By heating hydrocarbons in our laboratories until they become
incandescent, something like the comet spectrum may be artificially
produced, but the best approximation to it is obtained by passing a
disruptive electrical discharge through a tube in which fragments of
meteors have been placed. A flash of lightning is a disruptive
electrical discharge upon a grand scale. Now, meteors and electric
phenomena have been independently brought to our notice in connection
with comets, and with this suggestion it is easy to frame a general idea
of the physical condition of these objects--for example, a cloud of
meteors of different sizes so loosely clustered that the average density
of the swarm is very low indeed; the several particles in motion
relative to each other, as well as to the sun, and disturbed in that
motion by the sun's tidal action. Each particle carries its own electric
charge, which may be of higher or lower tension than that of its
neighbor, and is ready to leap across the intervening gap whenever two
particles approach each other. To these conditions add the inductive
effect of the sun's electric charge, which tends to produce a particular
and artificial distribution of electricity among the comet's particles,
and we may expect to find an endless succession of sparks, tiny
lightning flashes, springing from one particle to another, most frequent
and most vivid when the comet is near the sun, but never strong enough
to be separately visible. Their number is, however, great enough to make
the comet in part self-luminous with three kinds of light--i. e., the
three bright bands of its spectrum, whose wave lengths show in the comet
the same elements and compounds of the elements--carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen--which chemical analysis finds in the fallen meteor. It is not to
be supposed that these are the only chemical elements in the comet, as
they certainly are not the only ones in the meteor. They are the easy
ones to detect under ordinary circumstances, but in special cases, like
that of the Great Comet of 1882, whose near approach to the sun rendered
its whole substance incandescent, the spectrum glows with additional
bright lines of sodium, iron, etc.

183. COLLISIONS.--A question sometimes asked, What would be the effect
of a collision between the earth and a comet? finds its answer in the
results reached in the preceding sections. There would be a star
shower, more or less brilliant according to the number and size of the
pieces which made up the comet's head. If these were like the remains of
the Biela comet, the shower might even be a very tame one; but a
collision with a great comet would certainly produce a brilliant
meteoric display if its head came in contact with the earth. If the
comet were built of small pieces whose individual weights did not exceed
a few ounces or pounds, the earth's atmosphere would prove a perfect
shield against their attacks, reducing the pieces to harmless dust
before they could reach the ground, and leaving the earth uninjured by
the encounter, although the comet might suffer sadly from it. But big
stones in the comet, meteors too massive to be consumed in their flight
through the air, might work a very different effect, and by their
bombardment play sad havoc with parts of the earth's surface, although
any such result as the wrecking of the earth, or the destruction of all
life upon it, does not seem probable. The 40 meteors of § 169 may stand
for a collision with a small comet. Consult the Bible (Joshua x, 11) for
an example of what might happen with a larger one.




CHAPTER XIII

THE FIXED STARS


184. THE CONSTELLATIONS.--In the earlier chapters the student has
learned to distinguish between wandering stars (planets) and those fixed
luminaries which remain year after year in the same constellation,
shining for the most part with unvarying brilliancy, and presenting the
most perfect known image of immutability. Homer and Job and prehistoric
man saw Orion and the Pleiades much as we see them to-day, although the
precession, by changing their relation to the pole of the heavens, has
altered their risings and settings, and it may be that their luster has
changed in some degree as they grew old with the passing centuries.

[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Illustrating the division of the sky into
constellations.]

The division of the sky into constellations dates back to the most
primitive times, long before the Christian era, and the crooked and
irregular boundaries of these constellations, shown by the dotted lines
in Fig. 120, such as no modern astronomer would devise, are an
inheritance from antiquity, confounded and made worse in its descent to
our day. The boundaries assigned to constellations near the south pole
are much more smooth and regular, since this part of the sky, invisible
to the peoples from whom we inherit, was not studied and mapped until
more modern times. The old traditions associated with each constellation
a figure, often drawn from classical mythology, which was supposed to be
suggested by the grouping of the stars: thus Ursa Major is a great bear,
stalking across the sky, with the handle of the Dipper for his tail; Leo
is a lion; Cassiopeia, a lady in a chair; Andromeda, a maiden chained
to a rock, etc.; but for the most part the resemblances are far-fetched
and quite too fanciful to be followed by the ordinary eye.

185. THE NUMBER OF STARS.--"As numerous as the stars of heaven" is a
familiar figure of speech for expressing the idea of countless number,
but as applied to the visible stars of the sky the words convey quite a
wrong impression, for, under ordinary circumstances, in a clear sky
every star to be seen may be counted in the course of a few hours, since
they do not exceed 3,000 or 4,000, the exact number depending upon
atmospheric conditions and the keenness of the individual eye. Test your
own vision by counting the stars of the Pleiades. Six are easily seen,
and you may possibly find as many as ten or twelve; but however many are
seen, there will be a vague impression of more just beyond the limit of
visibility, and doubtless this impression is partly responsible for the
popular exaggeration of the number of the stars. In fact, much more than
half of what we call starlight comes from stars which are separately too
small to be seen, but whose number is so great as to more than make up
for their individual faintness.

The Milky Way is just such a cloud of faint stars, and the student who
can obtain access to a small telescope, or even an opera glass, should
not fail to turn it toward the Milky Way and see for himself how that
vague stream of light breaks up into shining points, each an independent
star. These faint stars, which are found in every part of the sky as
well as in the Milky Way, are usually called _telescopic_, in
recognition of the fact that they can be seen only in the telescope,
while the other brighter ones are known as _lucid stars_.

186. MAGNITUDES.--The telescopic stars show among themselves an even
greater range of brightness than do the lucid ones, and the system of
magnitudes (§ 9) has accordingly been extended to include them, the
faintest star visible in the greatest telescope of the present time
being of the sixteenth or seventeenth magnitude, while, as we have
already learned, stars on the dividing line between the telescopic and
the lucid ones are of the sixth magnitude. To compare the amount of
light received from the stars with that from the planets, and
particularly from the sun and moon, it has been found necessary to
prolong the scale of magnitudes backward into the negative numbers, and
we speak of the sun as having a stellar magnitude represented by the
number -26.5. The full moon's stellar magnitude is -12, and the planets
range from -3 (Venus) to +8 (Neptune). Even a very few of the stars are
so bright that negative magnitudes must be used to represent their true
relation to the fainter ones. Sirius, for example, the brightest of the
fixed stars, is of the -1 magnitude, and such stars as Arcturus and Vega
are of the 0 magnitude.

The relation of these magnitudes to each other has been so chosen that a
star of any one magnitude is very approximately 2.5 times as bright as
one of the next fainter magnitude, and this ratio furnishes a convenient
method of comparing the amount of light received from different stars.
Thus the brightness of Venus is 2.5 × 2.5 times that of Sirius. The full
moon is 2.5^{9} times as bright as Venus, etc.; only it should be
observed that the number 2.5 is not exactly the value of the _light
ratio_ between two consecutive magnitudes. Strictly this ratio is the
100^{1/5} = 2.5119+, so that to be entirely accurate we must say that
a difference of five magnitudes gives a hundredfold difference of
brightness. In mathematical symbols, if _B_ represents the ratio of
brightness (quantity of light) of two stars whose magnitudes are _m_ and
_n_, then

    B = (100)^{(m-n)/5}

How much brighter is an ordinary first-magnitude star, such as Aldebaran
or Spica, than a star just visible to the naked eye? How many of the
faintest stars visible in a great telescope would be required to make
one star just visible to the unaided eye? How many full moons must be
put in the sky in order to give an illumination as bright as daylight?
How large a part of the visible hemisphere would they occupy?

187. CLASSIFICATION BY MAGNITUDES.--The brightness of all the lucid
stars has been carefully measured with an instrument (photometer)
designed for that special purpose, and the following table shows,
according to the Harvard Photometry, the number of stars in the whole
sky, from pole to pole, which are brighter than the several magnitudes
named in the table:

    The number of stars brighter than magnitude 1.0 is    11
        "       "          "      "       "     2.0 "     39
        "       "          "      "       "     3.0 "    142
        "       "          "      "       "     4.0 "    463
        "       "          "      "       "     5.0 "  1,483
        "       "          "      "       "     6.0 "  4,326

It must not be inferred from this table that there are in the whole sky
only 4,326 stars visible to the naked eye. The actual number is probably
50 or 60 per cent greater than this, and the normal human eye sees stars
as faint as the magnitude 6.4 or 6.5, the discordance between this
number and the previous statement, that the sixth magnitude is the limit
of the naked-eye vision, having been introduced in the attempt to make
precise and accurate a classification into magnitudes which was at first
only rough and approximate. This same striving after accuracy leads to
the introduction of fractional numbers to represent gradations of
brightness intermediate between whole magnitudes. Thus of the 2,843
stars included between the fifth and sixth magnitudes a certain
proportion are said to be of the 5.1 magnitude, 5.2 magnitude, and so on
to the 5.9 magnitude, even hundredths of a magnitude being sometimes
employed.

We have found the number of stars included between the fifth and sixth
magnitudes by subtracting from the last number of the preceding table
the number immediately preceding it, and similarly we may find the
number included between each other pair of consecutive magnitudes, as
follows:

    Magnitude       0    1    2     3     4       5       6
    Number of stars   11   28   103   321   1,020   2,843
    4 × 3^{m}         12   36   108   324     972   2,916

In the last line each number after the first is found by multiplying the
preceding one by 3, and the approximate agreement of each such number
with that printed above it shows that on the whole, as far as the table
goes, the fainter stars are approximately three times as numerous as
those a magnitude brighter.

The magnitudes of the telescopic stars have not yet been measured
completely, and their exact number is unknown; but if we apply our
principle of a threefold increase for each successive magnitude, we
shall find for the fainter stars--those of the tenth and twelfth
magnitudes--prodigious numbers which run up into the millions, and even
these are probably too small, since down to the ninth or tenth magnitude
it is certain that the number of the telescopic stars increases from
magnitude to magnitude in more than a threefold ratio. This is balanced
in some degree by the less rapid increase which is known to exist in
magnitudes still fainter; and applying our formula without regard to
these variations in the rate of increase, we obtain as a rude
approximation to the total number of stars down to the fifteenth
magnitude, 86,000,000. The Herschels, father and son, actually counted
the number of stars visible in nearly 8,000 sample regions of the sky,
and, inferring the character of the whole sky from these samples, we
find it to contain 58,500,000 stars; but the magnitude of the faintest
star visible in their telescope, and included in their count, is rather
uncertain.

How many first-magnitude stars would be needed to give as much light as
do the 2,843 stars of magnitude 5.0 to 6.0? How many tenth-magnitude
stars are required to give the same amount of light?

To the modern man it seems natural to ascribe the different brilliancies
of the stars to their different distances from us; but such was not the
case 2,000 years ago, when each fixed star was commonly thought to be
fastened to a "crystal sphere," which carried them with it, all at the
same distance from us, as it turned about the earth. In breaking away
from this erroneous idea and learning to think of the sky itself as only
an atmospheric illusion through which we look to stars at very different
distances beyond, it was easy to fall into the opposite error and to
think of the stars as being much alike one with another, and, like
pebbles on the beach, scattered throughout space with some rough degree
of uniformity, so that in every direction there should be found in equal
measure stars near at hand and stars far off, each shining with a luster
proportioned to its remoteness.

188. DISTANCES OF THE STARS.--Now, in order to separate the true from
the false in this last mode of thinking about the stars, we need some
knowledge of their real distances from the earth, and in seeking it we
encounter what is perhaps the most delicate and difficult problem in the
whole range of observational astronomy. As shown in Fig. 121, the
principles involved in determining these distances are not fundamentally
different from those employed in determining the moon's distance from
the earth. Thus, the ellipse at the left of the figure represents the
earth's orbit and the position of the earth at different times of the
year. The direction of the star _A_ at these several times is shown by
lines drawn through _A_ and prolonged to the background apparently
furnished by the sky. A similar construction is made for the star _B_,
and it is readily seen that owing to the changing position of the
observer as he moves around the earth's orbit, both _A_ and _B_ will
appear to move upon the background in orbits shaped like that of the
earth as seen from the star, but having their size dependent upon the
star's distance, the apparent orbit of _A_ being larger than that of
_B_, because _A_ is nearer the earth. By measuring the angular distance
between _A_ and _B_ at opposite seasons of the year (e. g., the angles
_A--Jan.--B_, and _A--July--B_) the astronomer determines from the
change in this angle how much larger is the one path than the other, and
thus concludes how much nearer is _A_ than _B_. Strictly, the difference
between the January and July angles is equal to the difference between
the angles subtended at _A_ and _B_ by the diameter of the earth's
orbit, and if _B_ were so far away that the angle _Jan.--B--July_ were
nothing at all we should get immediately from the observations the angle
_Jan.--A--July_, which would suffice to determine the stars' distance.
Supposing the diameter of the earth's orbit and the angle at _A_ to be
known, can you make a graphical construction that will determine the
distance of _A_ from the earth?

[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Determining a star's parallax.]

The angle subtended at _A_ by the radius of the earth's orbit--i. e.,
1/2 (_Jan.--A--July_)--is called the star's parallax, and this is
commonly used by astronomers as a measure of the star's distance instead
of expressing it in linear units such as miles or radii of the earth's
orbit. The distance of a star is equal to the radius of the earth's
orbit divided by the parallax, in seconds of arc, and multiplied by the
number 206265.

A weak point of this method of measuring stellar distances is that it
always gives what is called a relative parallax--i. e., the difference
between the parallaxes of _A_ and _B_; and while it is customary to
select for _B_ a star or stars supposed to be much farther off than _A_,
it may happen, and sometimes does happen, that these comparison stars as
they are called are as near or nearer than _A_, and give a negative
parallax--i. e., the difference between the angles at _A_ and _B_ proves
to be negative, as it must whenever the star _B_ is nearer than _A_.

The first really successful determinations of stellar parallax were made
by Struve and Bessel a little prior to 1840, and since that time the
distances of perhaps 100 stars have been measured with some degree of
reliability, although the parallaxes themselves are so small--never as
great as 1''--that it is extremely difficult to avoid falling into
error, since even for the nearest star the problem of its distance is
equivalent to finding the distance of an object more than 5 miles away
by looking at it first with one eye and then with the other. Too short a
base line.

189. THE SUN AND HIS NEIGHBORS.--The distances of the sun's nearer
neighbors among the stars are shown in Fig. 122, where the two circles
having the sun at their center represent distances from it equal
respectively to 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 times the distance between earth
and sun. In the figure the direction of each star from the sun
corresponds to its right ascension, as shown by the Roman numerals about
the outer circle; the true direction of the star from the sun can not,
of course, be shown upon the flat surface of the paper, but it may be
found by elevating or depressing the star from the surface of the paper
through an angle, as seen from the sun, equal to its declination, as
shown in the fifth column of the following table,

190. LIGHT YEARS.--The radius of the inner circle in Fig. 122, 1,000,000
times the earth's distance from the sun, is a convenient unit in which
to express the stellar distances, and in the preceding table the
distances of the stars from the sun are expressed in terms of this
unit. To express them in miles the numbers in the table must be
multiplied by 93,000,000,000,000. The nearest star, α Centauri, is
25,000,000,000,000 miles away. But there is another unit in more common
use--i. e., the distance traveled over by light in the period of one
year. We have already found (§ 141) that it requires light 8m. 18s. to
come from the sun to the earth, and it is a simple matter to find from
this datum that in a year light moves over a space equal to 63,368 radii
of the earth's orbit. This distance is called a _light year_, and the
distance of the same star, α Centauri, expressed in terms of this
unit, is 4.26 years--i. e., it takes light that long to come from the
star to the earth.

In Fig. 122 the stellar magnitudes of the stars are indicated by the
size of the dots--the bigger the dot the brighter the star--and a mere
inspection of the figure will serve to show that within a radius of 30
light years from the sun bright stars and faint ones are mixed up
together, and that, so far as distance is concerned, the sun is only a
member of this swarm of stars, whose distances apart, each from its
nearest neighbor, are of the same order of magnitude as those which
separate the sun from the three or four stars nearest it.

Fig. 122 is not to be supposed complete. Doubtless other stars will be
found whose distance from the sun is less than 2,000,000 radii of the
earth's orbit, but it is not probable that they will ever suffice to
more than double or perhaps treble the number here shown. The vast
majority of the stars lie far beyond the limits of the figure.

191. PROPER MOTIONS.--It is evident that these stars are too far apart
for their mutual attractions to have much influence one upon another,
and that we have here a case in which, according to § 34, each star is
free to keep unchanged its state of rest or motion with unvarying
velocity along a straight line. Their very name, _fixed stars_, implies
that they are at rest, and so astronomers long believed. Hipparchus (125
B. C.) and Ptolemy (130 A. D.) observed and recorded many allineations
among the stars, in order to give to future generations a means of
settling this very question of a possible motion of the stars and a
resulting change in their relative positions upon the sky. For example,
they found at the beginning of the Christian era that the four stars,
Capella, ε Persei, α and β Arietis, stood in a straight line--i. e.,
upon a great circle of the sky. Verify this by direct reference to the
sky, and see how nearly these stars have kept the same position for
nearly twenty centuries. Three of them may be identified from the star
maps, and the fourth, ε Persei, is a third-magnitude star between
Capella and the other two.

Other allineations given by Ptolemy are: Spica, Arcturus and β Bootis;
Spica, δ Corvi and γ Corvi; α Libræ, Arcturus and ζ Ursæ Majoris.
Arcturus does not now fit very well to these alignments, and nearly two
centuries ago it, together with Aldebaran and Sirius, was on other
grounds suspected to have changed its place in the sky since the days of
Ptolemy. This discovery, long since fully confirmed, gave a great
impetus to observing with all possible accuracy the right ascensions and
declinations of the stars, with a view to finding other cases of what
was called _proper motion_--i. e., a motion peculiar to the individual
star as contrasted with the change of right ascension and declination
produced for all stars by the precession.

Since the middle of the eighteenth century there have been made many
thousands of observations of this kind, whose results have gone into
star charts and star catalogues, and which are now being supplemented by
a photographic survey of the sky that is intended to record permanently
upon photographic plates the position and magnitude of every star in the
heavens down to the fourteenth magnitude, with a view to ultimately
determining all their proper motions.

The complete achievement of this result is, of course, a thing of the
remote future, but sufficient progress in determining these motions has
been made during the past century and a half to show that nearly every
lucid star possesses some proper motion, although in most cases it is
very small, there being less than 100 known stars in which it amounts
to so much as 1" per annum--i. e., a rate of motion across the sky which
would require nearly the whole Christian era to alter a star's direction
from us by so much as the moon's angular diameter. The most rapid known
proper motion is that of a telescopic star midway between the equator
and the south pole, which changes its position at the rate of nearly 9"
per annum, and the next greatest is that of another telescopic star, in
the northern sky, No. 28 of Fig. 122. It is not until we reach the tenth
place in a list of large proper motions that we find a bright lucid
star, No. 1 of Fig. 122. It is a significant fact that for the most part
the stars with large proper motions are precisely the ones shown in Fig.
122, which is designed to show stars near the earth. This connection
between nearness and rapidity of proper motions is indeed what we should
expect to find, since a given amount of real motion of the star along
its orbit will produce a larger angular displacement, proper motion, the
nearer the star is to the earth, and this fact has guided astronomers in
selecting the stars to be observed for parallax, the proper motion being
determined first and the parallax afterward.

192. THE PATHS OF THE STARS.--We have already seen reason for thinking
that the orbit along which a star moves is practically a straight line,
and from a study of proper motions, particularly their directions across
the sky, it appears that these orbits point in all possible ways--north,
south, east, and west--so that some of them are doubtless directed
nearly toward or from the sun; others are square to the line joining sun
and star; while the vast majority occupy some position intermediate
between these two. Now, our relation to these real motions of the stars
is well illustrated in Fig. 112, where the observer finds in some of the
shooting stars a tremendous proper motion across the sky, but sees
nothing of their rapid approach to him, while others appear to stand
motionless, although, in fact, they are moving quite as rapidly as are
their fellows. The fixed star resembles the shooting star in this
respect, that its proper motion is only that part of its real motion
which lies at right angles to the line of sight, and this needs to be
supplemented by that other part of the motion which lies parallel to the
line of sight, in order to give us any knowledge of the star's real
orbit.

[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Motion of Polaris in the line of sight as
determined by the spectroscope. FROST.]

193. MOTION IN THE LINE OF SIGHT.--It is only within the last 25 years
that anything whatever has been accomplished in determining these
stellar motions of approach or recession, but within that time much
progress has been made by applying the Doppler principle (§ 89) to the
study of stellar spectra, and at the present time nearly every great
telescope in the world is engaged upon work of this kind. The shifting
of the lines of the spectrum toward the violet or toward the red end of
the spectrum indicates with certainty the approach or recession of the
star, but this shifting, which must be determined by comparing the
star's spectrum with that of some artificial light showing corresponding
lines, is so small in amount that its accurate measurement is a matter
of extreme difficulty, as may be seen from Fig. 123. This cut shows
along its central line a part of the spectrum of Polaris, between wave
lengths 4,450 and 4,600 tenth meters, while above and below are the
corresponding parts of the spectrum of an electric spark whose light
passed through the same spectroscope and was photographed upon the same
plate with that of Polaris. This comparison spectrum is, as it should
be, a discontinuous or bright-line one, while the spectrum of the star
is a continuous one, broken only by dark gaps or lines, many of which
have no corresponding lines in the comparison spectrum. But a certain
number of lines in the two spectra do correspond, save that the dark
line is always pushed a very little toward the direction of shorter wave
lengths, showing that this star is approaching the earth. This spectrum
was photographed for the express purpose of determining the star's
motion in the line of sight, and with it there should be compared Figs.
124 and 125, which show in the upper part of each a photograph obtained
without comparison spectra by allowing the star's light to pass through
some prisms placed just in front of the telescope. The lower section of
each figure shows an enlargement of the original photograph, bringing
out its details in a way not visible to the unaided eye. In the enlarged
spectrum of β Aurigæ a rate of motion equal to that of the
earth in its orbit would be represented by a shifting of 0.03 of a
millimeter in the position of the broad, hazy lines.

[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Spectrum of β Aurigæ.--PICKERING.]

Despite the difficulty of dealing with such small quantities as the
above, very satisfactory results are now obtained, and from them it is
known that the velocities of stars in the line of sight are of the same
order of magnitude as the velocities of the planets in their orbits,
ranging all the way from 0 to 60 miles per second--more than 200,000
miles per hour--which latter velocity, according to Campbell, is the
rate at which μ Cassiopeiæ is approaching the sun.

The student should not fail to note one important difference between
proper motions and the motions determined spectroscopically: the latter
are given directly in miles per second, or per hour, while the former
are expressed in angular measure, seconds of arc, and there can be no
direct comparison between the two until by means of the known distances
of the stars their proper motions are converted from angular into linear
measure. We are brought thus to the very heart of the matter; parallax,
proper motion, and motion in the line of sight are intimately related
quantities, all of which are essential to a knowledge of the real
motions of the stars.

[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Spectrum of Pollux.--PICKERING.]

194. STAR DRIFT.--An illustration of how they may be made to work
together is furnished by some of the stars--which make up the Great
Dipper--β, γ, ε, and ζ Ursæ Majoris, whose proper motions have
long been known to point in nearly the same direction across the sky and
to be nearly equal in amount. More recently it has been found that these
stars are all moving toward the sun with approximately the same
velocity--18 miles per second. One other star of the Dipper, δ Ursæ
Majoris, shares in the common proper motion, but its velocity in the
line of sight has not yet been determined with the spectroscope. These
similar motions make it probable that the stars are really traveling
together through space along parallel lines; and on the supposition
that such is the case it is quite possible to write out a set of
equations which shall involve their known proper motions and motions in
the line of sight, together with their unknown distances and the unknown
direction and velocity of their real motion along their orbits. Solving
these equations for the values of the unknown quantities, it is found
that the five stars probably lie in a plane which is turned nearly
edgewise toward us, and that in this plane they are moving about twice
as fast as the earth moves around the sun, and are at a distance from us
represented by a parallax of less than 0.02"--i. e., six times as great
as the outermost circle in Fig. 122. A most extraordinary system of
stars which, although separated from each other by distances as great as
the whole breadth of Fig. 122, yet move along in parallel paths which it
is difficult to regard as the result of chance, and for which it is
equally difficult to frame an explanation.

[Illustration: FIG. 126.--The Great Dipper, past, present, and future.]

The stars α and η of the Great Dipper do not share in this motion, and
must ultimately part company with the other five, to the complete
destruction of the Dipper's shape. Fig. 126 illustrates this change of
shape, the upper part of the figure (_a_) showing these seven stars as
they were grouped at a remote epoch in the past, while the lower
section (_c_) shows their position for an equally remote epoch in the
future. There is no resemblance to a dipper in either of these
configurations, but it should be observed that in each of them the stars
α and η keep their relative position unaltered, and the other five stars
also keep together, the entire change of appearance being due to the
changing positions of these two groups with respect to each other.

This phenomenon of groups of stars moving together is called _star
drift_, and quite a number of cases of it are found in different parts
of the sky. The Pleiades are perhaps the most conspicuous one, for here
some sixty or more stars are found traveling together along similar
paths. Repeated careful measurements of the relative positions of stars
in this cluster show that one of the lucid stars and four or five of the
telescopic ones do not share in this motion, and therefore are not to be
considered as members of the group, but rather as isolated stars which,
for a time, chance to be nearly on line with the Pleiades, and probably
farther off, since their proper motions are smaller.

To rightly appreciate the extreme slowness with which proper motions
alter the constellations, the student should bear in mind that the
changes shown in passing from one section of Fig. 126 to the next
represent the effect of the present proper motions of the stars
accumulated for a period of 200,000 years. Will the stars continue to
move in straight paths for so long a time?

195. THE SUN'S WAY.--Another and even more interesting application of
proper motions and motions in the line of sight is the determination
from them of the sun's orbit among the stars. The principle involved is
simple enough. If the sun moves with respect to the stars and carries
the earth and the other planets year after year into new regions of
space, our changing point of view must displace in some measure every
star in the sky save those which happen to be exactly on the line of the
sun's motion, and even these will show its effect by their apparent
motion of approach or recession along the line of sight. So far as their
own orbital motions are concerned, there is no reason to suppose that
more stars move north than south, or that more go east than west; and
when we find in their proper motions a distinct tendency to radiate from
a point somewhere near the bright star Vega and to converge toward a
point on the opposite side of the sky, we infer that this does not come
from any general drift of the stars in that direction, but that it marks
the course of the sun among them. That it is moving along a straight
line pointing toward Vega, and that at least a part of the velocities
which the spectroscope shows in the line of sight, comes from the motion
of the sun and earth. Working along these lines, Kapteyn finds that the
sun is moving through space with a velocity of 11 miles per second,
which is decidedly below the average rate of stellar motion--19 miles
per second.

196. DISTANCE OF SIRIAN AND SOLAR STARS.--By combining this rate of
motion of the sun with the average proper motions of the stars of
different magnitudes, it is possible to obtain some idea of the average
distance from us of a first-magnitude star or a sixth-magnitude star,
which, while it gives no information about the actual distance of any
particular star, does show that on the whole the fainter stars are more
remote. But here a broad distinction must be drawn. By far the larger
part of the stars belong to one of two well-marked classes, called
respectively Sirian and solar stars, which are readily distinguished
from each other by the kind of spectrum they furnish. Thus β
Aurigæ belongs to the Sirian class, as does every other star which has a
spectrum like that of Fig. 124, while Pollux is a solar star presenting
in Fig. 125 a spectrum like that of the sun, as do the other stars of
this class.

Two thirds of the sun's near neighbors, shown in Fig. 122, have spectra
of the solar type, and in general stars of this class are nearer to us
than are the stars with spectra unlike that of the sun. The average
distance of a solar star of the first magnitude is very approximately
represented by the outer circle in Fig. 122, 2,000,000 times the
distance of the sun from the earth; while the corresponding distance for
a Sirian star of the first magnitude is represented by the number
4,600,000.

A third-magnitude star is on the average twice as far away as one of the
first magnitude, a fifth-magnitude star four times as far off, etc.,
each additional two magnitudes doubling the average distance of the
stars, at least down to the eighth magnitude and possibly farther,
although beyond this limit we have no certain knowledge. Put in another
way, the naked eye sees many Sirian stars which _may_ have "gone out"
and ceased to shine centuries ago, for the light by which we now see
them left those stars before the discovery of America by Columbus. For
the student of mathematical tastes we note that the results of Kapteyn's
investigation of the mean distances (_D_) of the stars of magnitude
(_m_) may be put into two equations:

    For Solar Stars, D = 23 × 2^{m/2}

    For Sirian Stars, D = 52 × 2^{m/2}

where the coefficients 23 and 52 are expressed in light years. How long
a time is required for light to come from an average solar star of the
sixth magnitude?

197. CONSEQUENCES OF STELLAR DISTANCE.--The amount of light which comes
to us from any luminous body varies inversely as the square of its
distance, and since many of the stars are changing their distance from
us quite rapidly, it must be that with the lapse of time they will grow
brighter or fainter by reason of this altered distance. But the
distances themselves are so great that the most rapid known motion in
the line of sight would require more than 1,000 years (probably several
thousand) to produce any perceptible change in brilliancy.

The law in accordance with which this change of brilliancy takes place
is that the distance must be increased or diminished tenfold in order to
produce a change of five magnitudes in the brightness of the object, and
we may apply this law to determine the sun's rank among the stars. If it
were removed to the distance of an average first-, or second-, or
third-magnitude star, how would its light compare with that of the
stars? The average distance of a third-magnitude star of the solar type
is, as we have seen above, 4,000,000 times the sun's distance from the
earth, and since 4,000,000 = 10^{6.6}, we find that at this distance the
sun's stellar magnitude would be altered by 6.6 × 5 magnitudes, and
would therefore be -26.5 + 33.0 = 6.5--i. e., the sun if removed to the
average distance of the third-magnitude stars of its type would be
reduced to the very limit of naked-eye visibility. It must therefore be
relatively small and feeble as compared with the brightness of the
average star. It is only its close proximity to us that makes the sun
look brighter than the stars.

The fixed stars may have planets circling around them, but an
application of the same principles will show how hopeless is the
prospect of ever seeing them in a telescope. If the sun's nearest
neighbor, α Centauri, were attended by a planet like Jupiter, this
planet would furnish to us no more light than does a star of the
twenty-second magnitude--i. e., it would be absolutely invisible, and
would remain invisible in the most powerful telescope yet built, even
though its bulk were increased to equal that of the sun. Let the student
make the computation leading to this result, assuming the stellar
magnitude of Jupiter to be -1.7.

198. DOUBLE STARS.--In the constellation Taurus, not far from Aldebaran,
is the fourth-magnitude star θ Tauri, which can readily be seen to
consist of two stars close together. The star α Capricorni is plainly
double, and a sharp eye can detect that one of the faint stars which
with Vega make a small equilateral triangle, is also a double star.
Look for them in the sky.

In the strict language of astronomy the term double star would not be
applied to the first two of these objects, since it is usually
restricted to those stars whose angular distance from each other is so
small that in the telescope they appear much as do the stars named above
to the naked eye--i. e., their angular separation is measured by a few
seconds or fractions of a single second, instead of the six minutes
which separate the component stars of θ Tauri or α Capricorni. There are
found in the sky many thousands of these close double stars, of which
some are only optically double--i. e., two stars nearly on line with the
earth but at very different distances from it--while more of them are
really what they seem, stars near each other, and in many cases near
enough to influence each other's motion. These are called _binary_
systems, and in cases of this kind the principles of celestial mechanics
set forth in Chapter IV hold true, and we may expect to find each
component of a double star moving in a conic section of some kind,
having its focus at the common center of gravity of the two stars.
We are thus presented with problems of orbital motion quite similar
to those which occur in the solar system, and careful telescopic
observations are required year after year to fix the relative positions
of the two stars--i. e., their angular separation, which it is customary
to call their _distance_, and their direction one from the other, which
is called _position angle_.

199. ORBITS OF DOUBLE STARS.--The sun's nearest neighbor, α Centauri, is
such a double star, whose position angle and distance have been measured
by successive generations of astronomers for more than a century, and
Fig. 127 shows the result of plotting their observations. Each black dot
that lies on or near the circumference of the long ellipse stands for
an observed direction and distance of the fainter of the two stars from
the brighter one, which is represented by the small circle at the
intersection of the lines inside the ellipse. It appears from the figure
that during this time the one star has gone completely around the other,
as a planet goes around the sun, and the true orbit must therefore be
an ellipse having one of its foci at the center of gravity of the two
stars. The other star moves in an ellipse of precisely similar shape,
but probably smaller size, since the dimensions of the two orbits are
inversely proportional to the masses of the two bodies, but it is
customary to neglect this motion of the larger star and to give to the
smaller one an orbit whose diameter is equal to the sum of the diameters
of the two real orbits. This practice, which has been followed in Fig.
127, gives correctly the relative positions of the two stars, and makes
one orbit do the work of two.

[Illustration: FIG. 127.--The orbit of α Centauri.--SEE.]

In Fig. 127 the bright star does not fall anywhere near the focus of the
ellipse marked out by the smaller one, and from this we infer that the
figure does not show the true shape of the orbit, which is certainly
distorted, foreshortened, by the fact that we look obliquely down upon
its plane. It is possible, however, by mathematical analysis, to find
just how much and in what direction that plane should be turned in order
to bring the focus of the ellipse up to the position of the principal
star, and thus give the true shape and size of the orbit. See Fig. 128
for a case in which the true orbit is turned exactly edgewise toward the
earth, and the small star, which really moves in an ellipse like that
shown in the figure, appears to oscillate to and fro along a straight
line drawn through the principal star, as shown at the left of the
figure.

In the case of α Centauri the true orbit proves to have a major
axis 47 times, and a minor axis 40 times, as great as the distance of
the earth from the sun. The orbit, in fact, is intermediate in size
between the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, and the periodic time of the
star in this orbit is 81 years, a little less than the period of Uranus.

[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Apparent orbit and real orbit of the double
star 42 Comæ Berenicis.--SEE.]

200. MASSES OF DOUBLE STARS.--If we apply to this orbit Kepler's Third
Law in the form given it at page 179, we shall find--

    a^3 / T^2 = (23.5)^3 / (81)^2 = k (M + m),

where _M_ and _m_ represent the masses of the two stars. We have already
seen that _k_, the gravitation constant, is equal to 1 when the masses
are measured in terms of the sun's mass taken as unity, and when _T_ and
_a_ are expressed in years and radii of the earth's orbit respectively,
and with this value of _k_ we may readily find from the above equation,
_M_ + _m_ = 2.5--i. e., the combined mass of the two components of
α Centauri is equal to rather more than twice the mass of the sun. It is
not every double star to which this process of weighing can be applied.
The major axis of the orbit, _a_, is found from the observations in
angular measure, 35" in this case, and it is only when the parallax of
the star is known that this can be converted into the required linear
units, radii of the earth's orbit, by dividing the angular major axis by
the parallax; 47 = 35" ÷ 0.75".

Our list of distances (§ 189) contains four double stars whose periodic
times and major axes have been fairly well determined, and we find in
the accompanying table the information which they give about the masses
of double stars and the size of the orbits in which they move:

  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------
  STAR.                | Major | Minor | Periodic | Mass.
                       | axis. | axis. | time.    |
  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------
  α Centauri           |  47   |  40   |   81 y.  |   2
  70 Ophiuchi          |  56   |  48   |   88     |   3
  Procyon              |  34   |  31   |   40     |   3
  Sirius               |  43   |  34   |   52     |   4
  ---------------------+-------+-------+----------+-------

The orbit of Uranus, diameter = 38, and Neptune, diameter = 60, are of
much the same size as these double-star orbits; but the planetary orbits
are nearly circular, while in every case the double stars show a
substantial difference between the long and short diameters of their
orbits. This is a characteristic feature of most double-star orbits, and
seems to stand in some relation to their periodic times, for, on the
average, the longer the time required by a star to make its orbital
revolution the more eccentric is its orbit likely to prove.

Another element of the orbits of double stars, which stands in even
closer relation to the periodic time, is the major axis; the smaller the
long diameter of the orbit the more rapid is the motion and the shorter
the periodic time, so that astronomers in search of interesting
double-star orbits devote themselves by preference to those stars whose
distance apart is so small that they can barely be distinguished one
from the other in the telescope.

Although the half-dozen stars contained in the table all have orbits of
much the same size and with much the same periodic time as those in
which Uranus and Neptune move, this is by no means true of all the
double stars, many of which have periods running up into the hundreds if
not thousands of years, while a few complete their orbital revolutions
in periods comparable with, or even shorter than, that of Jupiter.

201. DARK STARS.--Procyon, the next to the last star of the preceding
table, calls for some special mention, as the determination of its mass
and orbit stands upon a rather different basis from that of the other
stars. More than half a century ago it was discovered that its proper
motion was not straight and uniform after the fashion of ordinary stars,
but presented a series of loops like those marked out by a bright point
on the rim of a swiftly running bicycle wheel. The hub may move straight
forward with uniform velocity, but the point near the tire goes up and
down, and, while sharing in the forward motion of the hub, runs
sometimes ahead of it, sometimes behind, and such seemed to be the
motion of Procyon and of Sirius as well. Bessel, who discovered it, did
not hesitate to apply the laws of motion, and to affirm that this
visible change of the star's motion pointed to the presence of an unseen
companion, which produced upon the motions of Sirius and Procyon just
such effects as the visible companions produce in the motions of double
stars. A new kind of star, dark instead of bright, was added to the
astronomer's domain, and its discoverer boldly suggested the possible
existence of many more. "That countless stars are visible is clearly no
argument against the existence of as many more invisible ones." "There
is no reason to think radiance a necessary property of celestial
bodies." But most astronomers were incredulous, and it was not until
1862 that, in the testing of a new and powerful telescope just built, a
dark star was brought to light and the companion of Sirius actually
seen. The visual discovery of the dark companion of Procyon is of still
more recent date (November, 1896), when it was detected with the great
telescope of the Lick Observatory. This discovery is so recent that the
orbit is still very uncertain, being based almost wholly upon the
variations in the proper motion of the star, and while the periodic time
must be very nearly correct, the mass of the stars and dimensions of the
orbit may require considerable correction.

The companion of Sirius is about ten magnitudes and that of Procyon
about twelve magnitudes fainter than the star itself. How much more
light does the bright star give than its faint companion? Despite the
tremendous difference of brightness represented by the answer to this
question, the mass of Sirius is only about twice as great as that of its
companion, and for Procyon the ratio does not exceed five or six.

The visual discovery of the companions to Sirius and Procyon removes
them from the list of dark stars, but others still remain unseen,
although their existence is indicated by variable proper motions or by
variable orbital motion, as in the case of ζ Cancri, where one
of the components of a triple star moves around the other two in a
series of loops whose presence indicates a disturbing body which has
never yet been seen.

202. MULTIPLE STARS.--Combinations of three, four, or more stars close
to each other, like ζ Cancri, are called multiple stars, and
while they are far from being as common as are double stars, there is a
considerable number of them in the sky, 100 or more as against the more
than 10,000 double stars that are known. That their relative motions are
subject to the law of gravitation admits of no serious doubt, but
mathematical analysis breaks down in face of the difficulties here
presented, and no astronomer has ever been able to determine what will
be the general character of the motions in such a system.

[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Illustrating the motion of a spectroscopic
binary.]

203. SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES.--In the year 1890 Professor Pickering, of
the Harvard Observatory, announced the discovery of a new class of
double stars, invisible as such in even the most powerful telescope,
and producing no perturbations such as have been considered above, but
showing in their spectrum that two or more bodies must be present in the
source of light which to the eye is indistinguishable from a single
star. In Fig. 129 we suppose _A_ and _B_ to be the two components of a
double star, each moving in its own orbit about their common center of
gravity, _C_, whose distance from the earth is several million times
greater than the distance between the stars themselves. Under such
circumstances no telescope could distinguish between the two stars,
which would appear fused into one; but the smaller the orbit the more
rapid would be their motion in it, and if this orbit were turned
edgewise toward the earth, as is supposed in the figure, whenever the
stars were in the relative position there shown, _A_ would be rapidly
approaching the earth by reason of its orbital motion, while _B_ would
move away from it, so that in accordance with the Doppler principle the
lines composing their respective spectra would be shifted in opposite
directions, thus producing a doubling of the lines, each single line
breaking up into two, like the double-sodium line _D_, only not spaced
so far apart. When the stars have moved a quarter way round their orbit
to the points _A´_, _B´_, their velocities are turned at right angles to
the line of sight and the spectrum returns to the normal type with
single lines, only to break up again when after another quarter
revolution their velocities are again parallel with the line of sight.
The interval of time between consecutive doublings of the lines in the
spectrum thus furnishes half the time of a revolution in the orbit. The
distance between the components of a double line shows by means of the
Doppler principle how fast the stars are traveling, and this in
connection with the periodic times fixes the size of the orbit, provided
we assume that it is turned exactly edgewise to the earth. This
assumption may not be quite true, but even though the orbit should
deviate considerably from this position, it will still present the
phenomenon of the double lines whose displacement will now show
something less than the true velocities of the stars in their orbits,
since the spectroscope measures only that component of the whole
velocity which is directed toward the earth, and it is important to note
that the real orbits and masses of these _spectroscopic binaries_, as
they are called, will usually be somewhat larger than those indicated by
the spectroscope, since it is only in exceptional cases that the orbit
will be turned exactly edgewise to us.

The bright star Capella is an excellent illustration of these
spectroscopic binaries. At intervals of a little less than a month the
lines of its spectrum are alternately single and double, their maximum
separation corresponding to a velocity in the line of sight amounting to
37 miles per second. Each component of a doubled line appears to be
shifted an equal amount from the position occupied by the line when it
is single, thus indicating equal velocities and equal masses for the two
component stars whose periodic time in their orbit is 104 days. From
this periodic time, together with the velocity of the star's motion, let
the student show that the diameter of the orbit--i. e., the distance of
the stars from each other--is approximately 53,000,000 miles, and that
their combined mass is a little less than that of α Centauri, provided
that their orbit plane is turned exactly edgewise toward the earth.

There are at the present time (1901) 34 spectroscopic binaries known,
including among them such stars as Polaris, Capella, Algol, Spica, β
Aurigæ, ζ Ursæ Majoris, etc., and their number is rapidly increasing,
about one star out of every seven whose motion in the line of sight
is determined proving to be a binary or, as in the case of Polaris,
possibly triple. On account of smaller distance apart their periodic
times are much shorter than those of the ordinary double stars, and
range from a few days up to several months--more than two years in the
case of η Pegasi, which has the longest known period of any star of this
class.

Spectroscopic binaries agree with ordinary double stars in having masses
rather greater than that of the sun, but there is as yet no assured case
of a mass ten times as great as that of the sun.

204. VARIABLE STARS.--Attention has already been drawn (§ 23) to the
fact that some stars shine with a changing brightness--e. g., Algol, the
most famous of these _variable stars_, at its maximum of brightness
furnishes three times as much light as when at its minimum, and other
variable stars show an even greater range. The star ο Ceti has
been named Mira (Latin, _the wonderful_), from its extraordinary range
of brightness, more than six-hundred-fold. For the greater part of the
time this star is invisible to the naked eye, but during some three
months in every year it brightens up sufficiently to be seen, rising
quite rapidly to its maximum brilliancy, which is sometimes that of a
second-magnitude star, but more frequently only third or even fourth
magnitude, and, after shining for a few weeks with nearly maximum
brilliancy, falling off to become invisible for a time and then return
to its maximum brightness after an interval of eleven months from the
preceding maximum. In 1901 it should reach its greatest brilliancy about
midsummer, and a month earlier than this for each succeeding year. Find
it by means of the star map, and by comparing its brightness from night
to night with neighboring stars of about the same magnitude see how it
changes with respect to them.

The interval of time from maximum to maximum of brightness--331.6 days
for Mira--is called the star's period, and within its period a star
regularly variable runs through all its changes of brilliancy, much as
the weather runs through its cycle of changes in the period of a year.
But, as there are wet years and dry ones, hot years and cold, so also
with variable stars, many of them show differences more or less
pronounced between different periods, and one such difference has
already been noted in the case of Mira; its maximum brilliancy is
different in different years. So, too, the length of the period
fluctuates in many cases, as does every other circumstance connected
with it, and predictions of what such a variable star will do are
notoriously unreliable.

205. THE ALGOL VARIABLES.--On the other hand, some variable stars
present an almost perfect regularity, repeating their changes time after
time with a precision like that of clockwork. Algol is one type of these
regular variables, having a period of 68.8154 hours, during six sevenths
of which time it shines with unchanging luster as a star of the 2.3
magnitude, but during the remaining 9 hours of each period it runs down
to the 3.5 magnitude, and comes back again, as is shown by a curve in
Fig. 130. The horizontal scale here represents hours, reckoned from the
time of the star's minimum brightness, and the vertical scale shows
stellar magnitudes. Such a diagram is called the star's light curve, and
we may read from it that at any time between 5h. and 32h. after the time
of minimum the star's magnitude is 2.32; at 2h. after a minimum the
magnitude is 2.88, etc. What is the magnitude an hour and a half before
the time of minimum? What is the magnitude 43 days after a minimum?

[Illustration: FIG. 130.--The light curve of Algol.]

The arrows shown in Fig. 130 are a feature not usually found with light
curves, but in this case each one represents a spectroscopic
determination of the motion of Algol in the line of sight. These
observations extended over a period of more than two years, but they are
plotted in the figure with reference to the number of hours each one
preceded or followed a minimum of the star's light, and each arrow shows
not only the direction of the star's motion along the line of sight, the
arrows pointing down denoting approach of the star toward the earth, but
also its velocity, each square of the ruling corresponding to 10
kilometers (6.2 miles per second). The differences of velocity shown by
adjacent arrows come mainly from errors of observation and furnish some
idea of how consistent among themselves such observations are, but there
can be no doubt that before minimum the star is moving away from the
earth, and after minimum is approaching it. It is evident from these
observations that in Algol we have to do with a spectroscopic binary,
one of whose components is a dark star which, once in each revolution,
partially eclipses the bright star and produces thus the variations in
its light. By combining the spectroscopic observations with the
variations in the star's light, Vogel finds that the bright star, Algol,
itself has a diameter somewhat greater than that of the sun, but is of
low density, so that its mass is less than half that of the sun, while
the dark star is a very little smaller than the sun and has about a
quarter of its mass. The distance between the two stars, dark and
bright, is 3,200,000 miles. Fig. 129, which is drawn to scale, shows the
relative positions and sizes of these stars as well as the orbits in
which they move.

The mere fact already noted that close binary systems exist in
considerable numbers is sufficient to make it probable that a certain
proportion of these stars would have their orbit planes turned so nearly
edgewise toward the earth as to produce eclipses, and corresponding to
this probability there are already known no less than 15 stars of the
Algol type of eclipse variables, and only a beginning has been made in
the search for them.

[Illustration: FIG. 131.--The light curve of β Lyræ.]

206. VARIABLES OF THE β LYRÆ TYPE.--In addition to these there
is a certain further number of binary variables in which both components
are bright and where the variation of brightness follows a very
different course. Capella would be such a variable if its orbit plane
were directed exactly toward the earth, and the fact that its light is
not variable shows conclusively that such is not the position of the
orbit. Fig. 131 represents the light curve of one of the best-known
variable systems of this second type, that of β Lyræ, whose
period is 12 days 21.8 hours, and the student should read from the curve
the magnitude of the star for different times during this interval.
According to Myers, this light curve and the spectroscopic observations
of the star point to the existence of a binary star of very remarkable
character, such as is shown, together with its orbit and a scale of
miles, in Fig. 132. Note the tide which each of these stars raises in
the other, thus changing their shapes from spheres into ellipsoids. The
astonishing dimensions of these stars are in part compensated by their
very low density, which is less than that of air, so that their masses
are respectively only 10 times and 21 times that of the sun! But these
dimensions and masses perhaps require confirmation, since they depend
upon spectroscopic observations of doubtful interpretation. In Fig. 132
what relative positions must the stars occupy in their orbit in order
that their combined light should give β Lyræ its maximum
brightness? What position will furnish a minimum brightness?

[Illustration: FIG. 132.--The system of β Lyræ.--MYERS.]

207. VARIABLES OF LONG AND SHORT PERIODS.--It must not be supposed that
all variable stars are binaries which eclipse each other. By far the
larger part of them, like Mira, are not to be accounted for in this way,
and a distinction which is pretty well marked in the length of their
periods is significant in this connection. There is a considerable
number of variable stars with periods shorter than a month, and there
are many having periods longer than 6 months, but there are very few
having periods longer than 18 months, or intermediate between 1 month
and 6 months, so that it is quite customary to divide variable stars
into two classes--those of long period, 6 months or more, and those of
short period less than 6 months, and that this distinction corresponds
to some real difference in the stars themselves is further marked by the
fact that the long-period variables are prevailingly red in color, while
the short-period stars are almost without exception white or very pale
yellow. In fact, the longer the period the redder the star, although it
is not to be inferred that all red stars are variable; a considerable
percentage of them shine with constant light. The eclipse explanation of
variability holds good only for short-period variables, and possibly not
for all of them, while for the long-period variables there is no
explanation which commands the general assent of astronomers, although
unverified hypotheses are plenty.

The number of stars known to be variable is about 400, while a
considerable number of others are "suspected," and it would not be
surprising if a large fraction of all the stars should be found to
fluctuate a little in brightness. The sun's spots may suffice to make it
a variable star with a period of 11 years.

The discovery of new variables is of frequent occurrence, and may be
expected to become more frequent when the sky is systematically explored
for them by the ingenious device suggested by Pickering and illustrated
in Fig. 133. A given region of the sky--e. g., the Northern Crown--is
photographed repeatedly upon the same plate, which is shifted a little
at each new exposure, so that the stars shall fall at new places upon
it. The finally developed plate shows a row of images corresponding to
each star, and if the star's light is constant the images in any given
row will all be of the same size, as are most of those in Fig. 133; but
a variable star such as is shown by the arrowhead reveals its presence
by the broken aspect of its row of dots, a minimum brilliancy being
shown by smaller and a maximum by larger ones. In this particular case,
at two exposures the star was too faint to print its image upon the
plate.

[Illustration: FIG. 133.--Discovery of a variable star by means of
photography.--PICKERING.]

208. NEW STARS.--Next to the variable stars of very long or very
irregular period stand the so-called _new_ or _temporary stars_, which
appear for the most part suddenly, and after a brief time either vanish
altogether or sink to comparative insignificance. These were formerly
thought to be very remarkable and unusual occurrences--"the birth of a
new world"--and it is noteworthy that no new star is recorded to have
been seen from 1670 to 1848 A. D., for since that time there have been
no less than five of them visible to the naked eye and others
telescopic. In so far as these new stars are not ordinary variables
(Mira, first seen in 1596, was long counted as a new star), they are
commonly supposed due to chance encounters between stars or other cosmic
bodies moving with considerable velocities along orbits which approach
very close to each other. The actual collision of two dark bodies moving
with high velocities is clearly sufficient to produce a luminous
star--e. g., meteors--and even the close approach of two cooled-off
stars, might result in tidal actions which would rend open their crusts
and pour out the glowing matter from within so as to produce temporarily
a very great accession of brightness.

The most famous of all new stars is that which, according to Tycho
Brahe's report, appeared in the year 1572, and was so bright when at its
best as to be seen with the naked eye in broad daylight. It continued
visible, though with fading light, for about 16 months, and finally
disappeared to the naked eye, although there is some reason to suppose
that it can be identified with a ruddy star of the eleventh magnitude in
the constellation Cassiopeia, whose light still shows traces of
variability.

No modern temporary star approaches that of Tycho in splendor, but in
some respects the recent ones surpass it in interest, since it has been
possible to apply the spectroscope to the analysis of their light and to
find thereby a much more complex set of conditions in the star than
would have been suspected from its light changes alone.

One of the most extraordinary of new stars, and the most brilliant one
since that of Tycho, appeared suddenly in the constellation Perseus in
February, 1901, and for a short time equaled Capella in brightness. But
its light rapidly waned, with periodic fluctuations of brightness like
those of a variable star, and at the present time (September, 1902) it
is lost to the naked eye, although in the telescope it still shines like
a star of the ninth or tenth magnitude.

By the aid of powerful photographic apparatus, during the period of its
waning brilliancy a ring of faint nebulous matter was detected
surrounding the star and drifting around and away from it much as if a
series of nebulæ had been thrown off by the star at the time of its
sudden outburst of light. But the extraordinary velocity of this nebular
motion, nearly a billion miles per hour, makes such an explanation
almost incredible, and astronomers are more inclined to believe that the
ring was merely a reflection of the star's own light from a cloud of
meteoric matter, into which a rapidly moving dark star plunged and,
after the fashion of terrestrial meteors, was raised to brilliant
incandescence by the collision. If we assume this to be the true
explanation of these extraordinary phenomena, it is possible to show
from the known velocity with which light travels through space and from
the rate at which the nebula spread, that the distance of Nova Persei,
as the new star is called, corresponds to a parallax of about one
one-hundredth of a second, a result that is, in substance, confirmed by
direct telescopic measurements of its parallax.

Another modern temporary star is Nova Aurigæ, which appeared suddenly in
December, 1891, waned, and in the following April vanished, only to
reappear three months later for another season of renewed brightness.
The spectra of both these modern Novæ contain both dark and bright lines
displaced toward opposite ends of the spectrum, and suggesting the
Doppler effect that would be produced by two or more glowing bodies
having rapid and opposite motions in the line of sight. But the most
recent investigations cast discredit on this explanation and leave the
spectra of temporary stars still a subject of debate among astronomers,
with respect both to the motion they indicate and the intrinsic nature
of the stars themselves. The varying aspect of the spectra suggested at
one time the sun's chromosphere, at another time the conditions that are
present in nebulæ, etc.




CHAPTER XIV

STARS AND NEBULÆ


209. STELLAR COLORS.--We have already seen that one star differs from
another in respect of color as well as brightness, and the diligent
student of the sky will not fail to observe for himself how the luster
of Sirius and Rigel is more nearly a pure white than is that of any
other stars in the heavens, while at the other end of the scale
α Orionis and Aldebaran are strongly ruddy, and Antares presents an
even deeper tone of red. Between these extremes the light of every star
shows a mixture of the rainbow hues, in which a very pale yellow is the
predominant color, shading off, as we have seen, to white at one end of
the scale and red at the other. There are no green stars, or blue stars,
or violet stars, save in one exceptional class of cases--viz., where the
two components of a double star are of very different brightness, it is
quite the usual thing for them to have different colors, and then,
almost without exception, the color of the fainter star lies nearer to
the violet end of the spectrum than does the color of the bright one,
and sometimes shows a distinctly blue or green hue. A fine type of such
double star is β Cygni, in which the components are respectively
yellow and blue, and the yellow star furnishes eight times as much light
as the blue one.

The exception which double stars thus make to the general rule of
stellar colors, yellow and red, but no color of shorter wave length, has
never been satisfactorily explained, but the rule itself presents no
difficulties. Each star is an incandescent body, giving off radiant
energy of every wave length within the limits of the visible spectrum,
and, indeed, far beyond these limits. If this radiant energy could come
unhindered to our eyes every star would appear white, but they are all
surrounded by atmospheres--analogous to the chromosphere and reversing
layer of the sun--which absorb a portion of their radiant energy and,
like the earth's atmosphere, take a heavier toll from the violet than
from the red end of the spectrum. The greater the absorption in the
star's atmosphere, therefore, the feebler and the ruddier will be its
light, and corresponding to this the red stars are as a class fainter
than the white ones.

210. CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.--The spectroscope is pre-eminently the
instrument to deal with this absorption of light in the stellar
atmospheres, just as it deals with that absorption in the sun's
atmosphere to which are due the dark lines of the solar spectrum,
although the faintness of starlight, compared with that of the sun,
presents a serious obstacle to its use. Despite this difficulty most of
the lucid stars and many of the telescopic ones have been studied with
the spectroscope and found to be similar to the sun and the earth as
respects the material of which they are made. Such familiar chemical
elements as hydrogen and iron, carbon, sodium, and calcium are scattered
broadcast throughout the visible universe, and while it would be
unwarranted by the present state of knowledge to say that the stars
contain nothing not found in the earth and the sun, it is evident that
in a broad way their substance is like rather than unlike that composing
the solar system, and is subject to the same physical and chemical laws
which obtain here. Galileo and Newton extended to the heavens the
terrestrial sciences of mathematics and mechanics, but it remained to
the nineteenth century to show that the physics and chemistry of the sky
are like the physics and chemistry of the earth.

211. STELLAR SPECTRA.--When the spectra of great numbers of stars are
compared one with another, it is found that they bear some relation to
the colors of the stars, as, indeed, we should expect, since spectrum
and color are both produced by the stellar atmospheres, and it is found
useful to classify these spectra into three types, as follows:

_Type I. Sirian stars._--Speaking generally, the stars which are white
or very faintly tinged with yellow, furnish spectra like that of Sirius,
from which they take their name, or that of β Aurigæ (Fig.
124), which is a continuous spectrum, especially rich in energy of short
wave length--i. e., violet and ultraviolet light, and is crossed by a
relatively small number of heavy dark lines corresponding to the
spectrum of hydrogen. Sometimes, however, these lines are much fainter
than is here shown, and we find associated with them still other faint
ones pointing to the presence of other metallic substances in the star's
atmosphere. These metallic lines are not always present, and sometimes
even the hydrogen lines themselves are lacking, but the spectrum is
always rich in violet and ultraviolet light.

Since with increasing temperature a body emits a continually increasing
proportion of energy of short wave length (§ 118), the richness of these
spectra in such energy points to a very high temperature in these stars,
probably surpassing in some considerable measure that of the sun. Stars
with this type of spectrum are more numerous than all others combined,
but next to them in point of numbers stands--

_Type II. Solar stars._--To this type of spectrum belong the yellow
stars, which show spectra like that of the sun, or of Pollux (Fig. 125).
These are not so rich in violet light as are those of Type I, but in
complexity of spectrum and in the number of their absorption lines they
far surpass the Sirian stars. They are supposed to be at a lower
temperature than the Sirian stars, and a much larger number of chemical
elements seems present and active in the reversing layer of their
atmospheres. The strong resemblance which these spectra bear to that of
the sun, together with the fact that most of the sun's stellar neighbors
have spectra of this type, justify us in ranking both them and it as
members of one class, called _solar stars_.

_Type III. Red stars._--A small number of stars show spectra comparable
with that of α Herculis (Fig. 134), in which the blue and the violet
part of the spectrum is almost obliterated, and the remaining yellow and
red parts show not only dark lines, but also numerous broad dark bands,
sharp at one edge, and gradually fading out at the other. It is this
_selective absorption_, extinguishing the blue and leaving the red end
of the spectrum, which produces the ruddy color of these stars, while
the bands in their spectra "are characteristic of chemical combinations,
and their presence ... proves that at certain elevations in the
atmospheres of these stars the temperature has sunk so low that chemical
combinations can be formed and maintained" (Scheiner-Frost). One of the
chemical compounds here indicated is a hydrocarbon similar to that found
in comets. In the white and yellow stars the temperatures are so high
that the same chemical elements, although present, can not unite one
with another to form compound substances.

[Illustration: FIG. 134.--The spectrum of α Herculis.--ESPIN.]

Most of the variable stars are red and have spectra of the third type;
but this does not hold true for the eclipse variables like Algol, all of
which are white stars with spectra of the first type. The ordinary
variable star is therefore one with a dense atmosphere of relatively low
temperature and complex structure, which produces the prevailing red
color of these stars by absorbing the major part of their radiant
energy of short wave length while allowing the longer, red waves to
escape. Although their exact nature is not understood, there can be
little doubt that the fluctuation in the light of these stars is due to
processes taking place within the star itself, but whether above or
below its photosphere is still uncertain.

212. CLASSES OF STARS.--There is no hard-and-fast dividing line between
these types of stellar spectra, but the change from one to another is by
insensible gradations, like the transition from youth to manhood and
from manhood to old age, and along the line of transition are to be
found numberless peculiarities and varieties of spectra not enumerated
above--e. g., a few stars show not only dark absorption lines in their
spectra but bright lines as well, which, like those in Fig. 48, point to
the presence of incandescent vapors, even in the outer parts of their
atmospheres. Among the lucid stars about 75 per cent have spectra of the
first type, 23 per cent are of the second type, 1 per cent of the third
type, and the remaining 1 per cent are peculiar or of doubtful
classification. Among the telescopic stars it is probable that much the
same distribution holds, but in the present state of knowledge it is not
prudent to speak with entire confidence upon this point.

That the great number of stars whose spectra have been studied should
admit of a classification so simple as the above, is an impressive fact
which, when supplemented by the further fact of a gradual transition
from one type of spectrum to the next, leaves little room for doubt that
in the stars we have an innumerable throng of individuals belonging to
the same species but in different stages of development, and that the
sun is only one of these individuals, of something less than medium size
and in a stage of development which is not at all peculiar, since it is
shared by nearly a fourth of all the stars.

213. STAR CLUSTERS.--In previous chapters we have noted the Pleiades and
Præsepe as star clusters visible to the naked eye, and to them we may
add the Hyades, near Aldebaran, and the little constellation Coma
Berenices. But more impressive than any of these, although visible only
in a telescope, is the splendid cluster in Hercules, whose appearance in
a telescope of moderate size is shown in Fig. 135, while Fig. 136 is a
photograph of the same cluster taken with a very large reflecting
telescope. This is only a type of many telescopic clusters which are
scattered over the sky, and which are made up of stars packed so closely
together as to become indistinguishable, one from another, at the center
of the cluster. Within an area which could be covered by a third of the
full moon's face are crowded in this cluster more than five thousand
stars which are unquestionably close neighbors, but whose apparent
nearness to each other is doubtless due to their great distance from us.
It is quite probable that even at the center of this cluster, where more
than a thousand stars are included within a radius of 160", the actual
distances separating adjoining stars are much greater than that
separating earth and sun, but far less than that separating the sun from
its nearest stellar neighbor.

[Illustration: FIG 135.--Star cluster in Hercules.]

An interesting discovery of recent date, made by Professor Bailey in
photographing star clusters, is that some few of them, which are
especially rich in stars, contain an extraordinary number of variable
stars, mostly very faint and of short period. Two clusters, one in the
northern and one in the southern hemisphere, contain each more than a
hundred variables, and an even more extraordinary case is presented by
a cluster, called Messier 5, not far from the star α Serpentis,
which contains no less than sixty-three variables, all about of the
fourteenth magnitude, all having light periods which differ but little
from half a day, all having light curves of about the same shape, and
all having a range of brightness from maximum to minimum of about one
magnitude. An extraordinary set of coincidences which "points
unmistakably to a common origin and cause of variability."

[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Star cluster in Hercules.--KEELER.]

[Illustration: FIG. 137.--The Andromeda nebula as seen in a very small
telescope.]

[Illustration: FIG. 138.--The Andromeda nebula and Holmes's comet.
Photographed by BARNARD.]

[Illustration: FIG. 139.--A drawing of the Andromeda nebula.]

[Illustration: FIG. 140.--A photograph of the Andromeda
nebula.--ROBERTS.]

214. NEBULÆ.--Returning to Fig. 136, we note that its background has a
hazy appearance, and that at its center the stars can no longer be
distinguished, but blend one with another so as to appear like a bright
cloud. The outer part of the cluster is _resolved_ into stars, while in
the picture the inner portion is not so resolved, although in the
original photographic plate the individual stars can be distinguished to
the very center of the cluster. In many cases, however, this is not
possible, and we have an _irresolvable cluster_ which it is customary to
call a _nebula_ (Latin, _little cloud_).

The most conspicuous example of this in the northern heavens is the
great nebula in Andromeda (R. A. 0^{h} 37^{m}, Dec. + 41°), which may be
seen with the naked eye as a faint patch of foggy light. Look for it.
This appears in an opera glass or very small telescope not unlike Fig.
137, which is reproduced from a sketch. Fig. 138 is from a photograph of
the same object showing essentially the same shape as in the preceding
figure, but bringing out more detail. Note the two small nebulæ
adjoining the large one, and at the bottom of the picture an object
which might easily be taken for another nebula but which is in fact a
tailless comet that chanced to be passing that part of the sky when the
picture was taken. Fig. 139 is from another drawing of this nebula,
although it is hardly to be recognized as a representation of the same
thing; but its characteristic feature, the two dark streaks near the
center of the picture, is justified in part by Fig. 140, which is from a
photograph made with a large reflecting telescope.

[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Types of nebulæ.]

A comparison of these several representations of the same thing will
serve to illustrate the vagueness of its outlines, and how much the
impressions to be derived from nebulæ depend upon the telescopes
employed and upon the observer's own prepossessions. The differences
among the pictures can not be due to any change in the nebula itself,
for half a century ago it was sketched much as shown in the latest of
them (Fig. 140).

[Illustration: FIG. 142.--The Trifid nebula.--KEELER.]

215. TYPICAL NEBULÆ.--Some of the fantastic forms which nebulæ present
in the telescope are shown on a small scale in Fig. 141, but in recent
years astronomers have learned to place little reliance upon drawings
such as these, which are now almost entirely supplanted by photographs
made with long exposures in powerful telescopes. One of the most
exquisite of these modern photographs is that of the Trifid nebula in
Sagittarius (Fig. 142). Note especially the dark lanes that give to this
nebula its name, Trifid, and which run through its brightest parts,
breaking it into seemingly independent sections. The area of the sky
shown in this cut is about 15 per cent less than that covered by the
full moon.

[Illustration: FIG. 143.--A nebula in Cygnus.--KEELER.]

Fig. 143 shows a very different type of nebula, found in the
constellation Cygnus, which appears made up of filaments closely
intertwined, and stretches across the sky for a distance considerably
greater than the moon's diameter.

[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Spiral nebula in Canes Venatici.--KEELER.]

A much smaller but equally striking nebula is that in the constellation
Canes Venatici (Fig. 144), which shows a most extraordinary spiral
structure, as if the stars composing it were flowing in along curved
lines toward a center of condensation. The diameter of the circular part
of this nebula, omitting the projection toward the bottom of the
picture, is about five minutes of arc, a sixth part of the diameter of
the moon, and its thickness is probably very small compared with its
breadth, perhaps not much exceeding the width of the spiral streams
which compose it. Note how the bright stars that appear within the area
of this nebula fall on the streams of nebulous matter as if they were
part of them. This characteristic grouping of the stars, which is
followed in many other nebulæ, shows that they are really part and
parcel of the nebula and not merely on line with it. Fig. 145 shows how
a great nebula is associated with the star ρ Ophiuchi.

[Illustration: FIG. 145.--Great nebula about the star ρ
Ophiuchi.--BARNARD.]

Probably the most impressive of all nebulæ is the great one in Orion
(Fig. 146), whose position is shown on the star map between Rigel and
ζ Orionis. Look for it with an opera glass or even with the
unaided eye. This is sometimes called an _amorphous_--i. e.,
shapeless--nebula, because it presents no definite form which the eye
can grasp and little trace of structure or organization. It is "without
form and void" at least in its central portions, although on its edges
curved filaments may be traced streaming away from the brighter parts
of the central region. This nebula, as shown in Fig. 146, covers an area
about equal to that of the full moon, without counting as any part of
this the companion nebula shown at one side, but photographs made with
suitable exposures show that faint outlying parts of the nebula extend
in curved lines over the larger part of the constellation Orion. Indeed,
over a large part of the entire sky the background is faintly covered
with nebulous light whose brighter portions, if each were counted as a
separate nebula, would carry the total number of such objects well into
the hundreds of thousands.

[Illustration: FIG. 146.--The Orion nebula.]

The Pleiades (Plate IV) present a case of a resolvable star cluster
projected against such a nebulous background whose varying intensity
should be noted in the figure. A part of this nebulous matter is shown
in wisps extending from one star to the next, after the fashion of a
bridge, and leaving little doubt that the nebula is actually a part of
the cluster and not merely a background for it.

[Illustration: THE PLEIADES (AFTER A PHOTOGRAPH)]

Fig. 147 shows a series of so-called double nebulæ perhaps comparable
with double stars, although the most recent photographic work seems to
indicate that they are really faint spiral nebulæ in which only the
brightest parts are shown by the telescope.

According to Keeler, the spiral is the prevailing type of nebulæ, and
while Fig. 144 presents the most perfect example of such a nebula, the
student should not fail to note that the Andromeda nebula (Fig. 140)
shows distinct traces of a spiral structure, only here we do not see its
true shape, the nebula being turned nearly edgewise toward us so that
its presumably circular outline is foreshortened into a narrow ellipse.

[Illustration: FIG. 147.--Double nebulæ. HERSCHEL.]

Another type of nebula of some consequence presents in the telescope
round disks like those of Uranus or Neptune, and this appearance has
given them the name _planetary nebulæ_. The comet in Fig. 138, if
smaller, would represent fairly well the nebulæ of this type. Sometimes
a planetary nebula has a star at its center, and sometimes it appears
hollow, like a smoke ring, and is then called a ring nebula. The most
famous of these is in the constellation Lyra, not far from Vega.

216. SPECTRA OF NEBULÆ.--A star cluster, like the one in Hercules,
shows, of course, stellar spectra, and even when irresolvable the
spectrum is a continuous one, testifying to the presence of stars,
although they stand too close together to be separately seen. But in a
certain number of nebulæ the spectrum is altogether different, a
discontinuous one containing only a few bright lines, showing that here
the nebular light comes from glowing gases which are subject to no
considerable pressure. The planetary nebulæ all have spectra of this
kind and make up about half of all the known gaseous nebulæ. It is
worthy of note that a century ago Sir William Herschel had observed a
green shimmer in the light of certain nebulæ which led him to believe
that they were "not of a starry nature," a conclusion which has been
abundantly confirmed by the spectroscope. The green shimmer is, in fact,
caused by a line in the green part of the spectrum that is always
present and is always the brightest part of the spectrum of gaseous
nebulæ.

In faint nebulæ this line constitutes the whole of their visible
spectrum, but in brighter ones two or three other and fainter lines are
usually associated with it, and a very bright nebula, like that in
Orion, may show a considerable number of extra lines, but for the most
part they can not be identified in the spectrum of any terrestrial
substances. An exception to this is found in the hydrogen lines, which
are well marked in most spectra of gaseous nebulæ, and there are
indications of one or two other known substances.

217. DENSITY OF NEBULÆ.--It is known from laboratory experiments that
diminishing the pressure to which an incandescent gas is subject,
diminishes the number of lines contained in its spectrum, and we may
surmise from the very simple character and few lines of these nebular
spectra that the gas which produces them has a very small density. But
this is far from showing that the nebula itself is correspondingly
attenuated, for we must not assume that this shining gas is all that
exists in the nebula; so far as telescope or camera are concerned, there
may be associated with it any amount of dark matter which can not be
seen because it sends to us no light. It is easy to think in this
connection of meteoric dust or the stuff of which comets are made, for
these seem to be scattered broadcast on every side of the solar system
and may, perchance, extend out to the region of the nebulæ.

But, whatever may be associated in the nebula with the glowing gas which
we see, the total amount of matter, invisible as well as visible, must
be very small, or rather its average density must be very small, for the
space occupied by such a nebula as that of Orion is so great that if the
average density of its matter were equal to that of air the resulting
mass by its attraction would exert a sensible effect upon the motion of
the sun through space. The brighter parts of this nebula as seen from
the earth subtend an angle of about half a degree, and while we know
nothing of its distance from us, it is easy to see that the farther it
is away the greater must be its real dimensions, and that this increase
of bulk and mass with increasing distance will just compensate the
diminishing intensity of gravity at great distances, so that for a given
angular diameter--e. g., half a degree--the force with which this nebula
attracts the sun depends upon its density but not at all upon its
distance. Now, the nebula must attract the sun in some degree, and must
tend to move it and the planets in an orbit about the attracting center
so that year after year we should see the nebula from slightly different
points of view, and this changed point of view should produce a change
in the apparent direction of the nebula from us--i. e., a proper motion,
whose amount would depend upon the attracting force, and therefore upon
the density of the attracting matter. Observations of the Orion nebula
show that its proper motion is wholly inappreciable, certainly far less
than half a second of arc per year, and corresponding to this amount of
proper motion the mean density of the nebula must be some millions of
times (10^{10} according to Ranyard) less than that of air at sea
level--i. e., the average density throughout the nebula is comparable
with that of those upper parts of the earth's atmosphere in which
meteors first become visible.

218. MOTION OF NEBULÆ.--The extreme minuteness of their proper motions
is a characteristic feature of all nebulæ. Indeed, there is hardly a
known case of sensible proper motion of one of these bodies, although a
dozen or more of them show velocities in the line of sight ranging in
amount from +30 to -40 miles per second, the plus sign indicating an
increasing distance. While a part of these velocities may be only
apparent and due to the motion of earth and sun through space, a part at
least is real motion of the nebulæ themselves. These seem to move
through the celestial spaces in much the same way and with the same
velocities as do the stars, and their smaller proper motions across the
line of sight (angular motions) are an index of their great distance
from us. No one has ever succeeded in measuring the parallax of a nebula
or star cluster.

[Illustration: FIG. 148.--A part of the Milky Way.]

The law of gravitation presumably holds sway within these bodies, and
the fact that their several parts and the stars which are involved
within them, although attracted by each other, have shown little or no
change of position during the past century, is further evidence of
their low density and feeble attraction. In a few cases, however, there
seem to be in progress within a nebula changes of brightness, so that
what was formerly a faint part has become a brighter one, or _vice
versa_; but, on the whole, even these changes are very small.

[Illustration: FIG. 149.--The Milky Way near θ Ophiuchi.--BARNARD.]

219. THE MILKY WAY.--Closely related to nebulæ and star clusters is
another feature of the sky, the _galaxy_ or _Milky Way_, with whose
appearance to the unaided eye the student should become familiar by
direct study of the thing itself. Figs. 148 and 149 are from photographs
of two small parts of it, and serve to bring out the small stars of
which it is composed. Every star shown in these pictures is invisible to
the naked eye, although their combined light is easily seen. The general
course of the galaxy across the heavens is shown in the star maps, but
these contain no indication of the wealth of detail which even the naked
eye may detect in it. Bright and faint parts, dark rifts which cut it
into segments, here and there a hole as if the ribbon of light had been
shot away--such are some of the features to be found by attentive
examination.

[Illustration: FIG. 150.--The Milky Way near β Cygni.--BARNARD.]

Speaking generally, the course of the Milky Way is a great circle
completely girdling the sky and having its north pole in the
constellation Coma Berenices. The width of this stream of light is very
different in different parts of the heavens, amounting where it is
widest, in Lyra and Cygnus, to something more than 30°, although its
boundaries are too vague and ill defined to permit much accuracy of
measurement. Observe the very bright part between β and γ Cygni, nearly
opposite Vega, and note how even an opera glass will partially resolve
the nebulous light into a great number of stars, which are here rather
brighter than in other parts of its course. But the resolution into
stars is only partial, and there still remains a background of
unresolved shimmer. Fig. 150 is a photograph of a small part of this
region in which, although each fleck of light represents a separate
star, the galaxy is not completely resolved. Compare with this region,
rich in stars, the nearly empty space between the branches of the galaxy
a little west of Altair. Another hole in the Milky Way may be found a
little north and east of α Cygni, and between the extremes of abundance
and poverty here noted there may be found every gradation of nebulous
light.

The Milky Way is not so simple in its structure as might at first be
thought, but a clear and moonless night is required to bring out its
details. The nature of these details, the structure of the galaxy, its
shape and extent, the arrangement of its parts, and their relation to
stars and nebulæ in general, have been subjects of much speculation by
astronomers and others who have sought to trace out in this way what is
called the _construction of the heavens_.

220. DISTRIBUTION OF THE STARS.--How far out into space do the stars
extend? Are they limited or infinite in number? Do they form a system of
mutually related parts, or are they bunched promiscuously, each for
itself, without reference to the others? Here is what has been well
called "the most important problem of stellar astronomy, the acquisition
of well-founded ideas about the distribution of the stars." While many
of the ideas upon this subject which have been advanced by eminent
astronomers and which are still current in the books are certainly
wrong, and few of their speculations along this line are demonstrably
true, the theme itself is of such grandeur and permanent interest as to
demand at least a brief consideration. But before proceeding to its
speculative side we need to collect facts upon which to build, and
these, however inadequate, are in the main simple and not far to seek.

Parallaxes, proper motions, motions in the line of sight, while
pertinent to the problem of stellar distribution, are of small avail,
since they are far too scanty in number and relate only to limited
classes of stars, usually the very bright ones or those nearest to the
sun. Almost the sole available data are contained in the brightness of
the stars and the way in which they seem scattered in the sky. The most
casual survey of the heavens is enough to show that the stars are not
evenly sprinkled upon it. The lucid stars are abundant in some regions,
few in others, and the laborious star gauges, actual counting of the
stars in sample regions of the sky, which have been made by the
Herschels, Celoria, and others, suffice to show that this lack of
uniformity in distribution is even more markedly true of the telescopic
stars.

The rate of increase in the number of stars from one magnitude to the
next, as shown in § 187, is proof of another kind of irregularity in
their distribution. It is not difficult to show, mathematically, that if
in distant regions of space the stars were on the average as numerous
and as bright as they are in the regions nearer to the sun, then the
stars of any particular magnitude ought to be four times as numerous as
those of the next brighter magnitude--e. g., four times as many
sixth-magnitude stars as there are fifth-magnitude ones. But, as we have
already seen in § 187, by actual count there are only three times as
many, and from the discrepancy between these numbers, an actual
threefold increase instead of a fourfold one, we must conclude that on
the whole the stars near the sun are either bigger or brighter or more
numerous than in the remoter depths of space.

221. THE STELLAR SYSTEM.--But the arrangement of the stars is not
altogether lawless and chaotic; there are traces of order and system,
and among these the Milky Way is the dominant feature. Telescope and
photographic plate alike show that it is made up of stars which,
although quite irregularly scattered along its course, are on the
average some twenty times as numerous in the galaxy as at its poles,
and which thin out as we recede from it on either side, at first rapidly
and then more slowly. This tendency to cluster along the Milky Way is
much more pronounced among the very faint telescopic stars than among
the brighter ones, for the lucid stars and the telescopic ones down to
the tenth or eleventh magnitude, while very plainly showing the
clustering tendency, are not more than three times as numerous in the
galaxy as in the constellations most remote from it. It is remarkable as
showing the condensation of the brightest stars that one half of all the
stars in the sky which are brighter than the second magnitude are
included within a belt extending 12° on either side of the center line
of the galaxy.

In addition to this general condensation of stars toward the Milky Way,
there are peculiarities in the distribution of certain classes of stars
which are worth attention. Planetary nebulæ and new stars are seldom, if
ever, found far from the Milky Way, and stars with bright lines in their
spectra especially affect this region of the sky. Stars with spectra of
the first type--Sirian stars--are much more strongly condensed toward
the Milky Way than are stars of the solar type, and in consequence of
this the Milky Way is peculiarly rich in light of short wave lengths.
Resolvable star clusters are so much more numerous in the galaxy than
elsewhere, that its course across the sky would be plainly indicated by
their grouping upon a map showing nothing but clusters of this kind.

On the other hand, nebulæ as a class show a distinct aversion for the
galaxy, and are found most abundantly in those parts of the sky farthest
from it, much as if they represented raw material which was lacking
along the Milky Way, because already worked up to make the stars which
are there so numerous.

222. RELATION OF THE SUN TO THE MILKY WAY.--The fact that the galaxy is
a _great circle_ of the sky, but only of moderate width, shows that it
is a widely extended and comparatively thin stratum of stars within
which the solar system lies, a member of the galactic system, and
probably not very far from its center. This position, however, is not to
be looked upon as a permanent one, since the sun's motion, which lies
nearly in the plane of the Milky Way, is ceaselessly altering its
relation to the center of that system, and may ultimately carry us
outside its limits.

The Milky Way itself is commonly thought to be a ring, or series of
rings, like the coils of the great spiral nebula in Andromeda, and
separated from us by a space far greater than the thickness of the ring
itself. Note in Figs. 149 and 150 how the background is made up of
bright and dark parts curiously interlaced, and presenting much the
appearance of a thin sheet of cloud through which we look to barren
space beyond. While, mathematically, this appearance can not be
considered as proof that the galaxy is in fact a distant ring, rather
than a sheet of starry matter stretching continuously from the nearer
stellar neighbors of the sun into the remotest depths of space,
nevertheless, most students of the question hold it to be such a ring of
stars, which are relatively close together while its center is
comparatively vacant, although even here are some hundreds of thousands
of stars which on the whole have a tendency to cluster near its plane
and to crowd together a little more densely than elsewhere in the region
where the sun is placed.

223. DIMENSIONS OF THE GALAXY.--The dimensions of this stellar system
are wholly unknown, but there can be no doubt that it extends farther in
the plane of the Milky Way than at right angles to that plane, for stars
of the fifteenth and sixteenth magnitudes are common in the galaxy, and
testify by their feeble light to their great distance from the earth,
while near the poles of the Milky Way there seem to be few stars fainter
than the twelfth magnitude. Herschel, with his telescope of 18 inches
aperture, could count in the Milky Way more than a dozen times as many
stars per square degree as could Celoria with a telescope of 4 inches
aperture; but around the poles of the galaxy the two telescopes showed
practically the same number of stars, indicating that here even the
smaller telescope reached to the limits of the stellar system. Very
recently, indeed, the telescope with which Fig. 140 was photographed
seems to have reached the farthest limit of the Milky Way, for on a
photographic plate of one of its richest regions Roberts finds it
completely resolved into stars which stand out upon a black background
with no trace of nebulous light between them.

224. BEYOND THE MILKY WAY.--Each additional step into the depths of
space brings us into a region of which less is known, and what lies
beyond the Milky Way is largely a matter of conjecture. We shrink from
thinking it an infinite void, endless emptiness, and our intellectual
sympathies go out to Lambert's speculation of a universe filled with
stellar systems, of which ours, bounded by the galaxy, is only one.
There is, indeed, little direct evidence that other such systems exist,
but the Andromeda nebula is not altogether unlike a galaxy with a
central cloud of stars, and in the southern hemisphere, invisible in our
latitudes, are two remarkable stellar bodies like the Milky Way in
appearance, but cut off from all apparent connection with it, much as we
might expect to find independent stellar systems, if such there be.

These two bodies are known as the Magellanic clouds, and individually
bear the names of Major and Minor Nubecula. According to Sir John
Herschel, "the Nubecula Major, like the Minor, consists partly of large
tracts and ill-defined patches of irresolvable nebula, and of nebulosity
in every stage of resolution up to perfectly resolved stars like the
Milky Way, as also of regular and irregular nebulæ ... of globular
clusters in every stage of resolvability, and of clustering groups
sufficiently insulated and condensed to come under the designation of
clusters of stars." Its outlines are vague and somewhat uncertain, but
surely include an area of more than 40 square degrees--i. e., as much as
the bowl of the Big Dipper--and within this area Herschel counted
several hundred nebulæ and clusters "which far exceeds anything that is
to be met with in any other region of the heavens." Although its
excessive complexity of detail baffled Herschel's attempts at artistic
delineation, it has yielded to the modern photographic processes, which
show the Nubecula Major to be an enormous spiral nebula made up of
subordinate stars, nebulæ, and clusters, as is the Milky Way.

Compared with the Andromeda nebula, its greater angular extent suggests
a smaller distance, although for the present all efforts at determining
the parallax of either seem hopeless. But the spiral form which is
common to both suggests that the Milky Way itself may be a gigantic
spiral nebula near whose center lies the sun, a humble member of a great
cluster of stars which is roughly globular in shape, but flattened at
the poles of the galaxy and completely encircled by its coils. However
plausible such a view may appear, it is for the present, at least, pure
hypothesis, although vigorously advocated by Easton, who bases his
argument upon the appearance of the galaxy itself.

225. ABSORPTION OF STARLIGHT.--We have had abundant occasion to learn
that at least within the confines of the solar system meteoric matter,
cosmic dust, is profusely scattered, and it appears not improbable that
the same is true, although in smaller degree, in even the remoter parts
of space. In this case the light which comes from the farther stars over
a path requiring many centuries to travel, must be in some measure
absorbed and enfeebled by the obstacles which it encounters on the way.
Unless celestial space is transparent to an improbable degree the
remoter stars do not show their true brightness; there is a certain
limit beyond which no star is able to send its light, and beyond which
the universe must be to us a blank. A lighthouse throws into the fog its
beams only to have them extinguished before a single mile is passed, and
though the celestial lights shine farther, a limit to their reach is
none the less certain if meteoric dust exists outside the solar system.
If there is such an absorption of light in space, as seems plausible,
the universe may well be limitless and the number of stellar systems
infinite, although the most attenuated of dust clouds suffices to
conceal from us and to shut off from our investigation all save a minor
fraction of it and them.




CHAPTER XV

GROWTH AND DECAY


226. NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.--To use a common figure of speech, the
universe is alive. We have found it filled with an activity that
manifests itself not only in the motions of the heavenly bodies along
their orbits, but which extends to their minutest parts, the molecules
and atoms, whose vibrations furnish the radiant energy given off by sun
and stars. Some of these activities, such as the motions of the heavenly
bodies in their orbits, seem fitted to be of endless duration; while
others, like the radiation of light and heat, are surely temporary, and
sooner or later must come to an end and be replaced by something
different. The study of things as they are thus leads inevitably to
questions of what has been and what is to be. A sound science should
furnish some account of the universe of yesterday and to-morrow as well
as of to-day, and we need not shrink from such questions, although
answers to them must be vague and in great measure speculative.

The historian of America finds little difficulty with events of the
nineteenth century or even the eighteenth, but the sources of
information about America in the fifteenth century are much less
definite; the tenth century presents almost a blank, and the history of
American mankind in the first century of the Christian era is wholly
unknown. So, as we attempt to look into the past or the future of the
heavens, we must expect to find the mists of obscurity grow denser with
remoter periods until even the vaguest outlines of its development are
lost, and we are compelled to say, beyond this lies the unknown. Our
account of growth and decay in the universe, therefore, can not aspire
to cover the whole duration of things, but must be limited in its scope
to certain chapters whose epochs lie near to the time in which we live,
and even for these we need to bear constantly in mind the logical bases
of such an inquiry and the limitations which they impose upon us.

227. LOGICAL BASES AND LIMITATIONS.--The first of these bases is: An
adequate knowledge of the present universe. Our only hope of reading the
past and future lies in an understanding of the present; not necessarily
a complete knowledge of it, but one which is sound so far as it goes.
Our position is like that of a detective who is called upon to unravel a
mystery or crime, and who must commence with the traces that have been
left behind in its commission. The foot print, the blood stain, the
broken glass must be examined and compared, and fashioned into a theory
of how they came to be; and as a wrong understanding of these elements
is sure to vitiate the theories based upon them, so a false science of
the universe as it now is, will surely give a false account of what it
has been; while a correct but incomplete knowledge of the present does
not wholly bar an understanding of the past, but only puts us in the
position of the detective who correctly understands what he sees but
fails to take note of other facts which might greatly aid him.

The second basis of our inquiry is: The assumed permanence of natural
laws. The law of gravitation certainly held true a century ago as well
as a year ago, and for aught we know to the contrary it may have been a
law of the universe for untold millions of years; but that it has
prevailed for so long a time is a pure assumption, although a necessary
one for our purpose. So with those other laws of mathematics and
mechanics and physics and chemistry to which we must appeal; if there
was ever a time or place in which they did not hold true, that time and
place lie beyond the scope of our inquiry, and are in the domain
inaccessible to scientific research. It is for this reason that science
knows nothing and can know nothing of a creation or an end of the
universe, but considers only its orderly development within limited
periods of time. What kind of a past universe would, under the operation
of known laws, develop into the present one, is the question with which
we have to deal, and of it we may say with Helmholtz: "From the
standpoint of science this is no idle speculation but an inquiry
concerning the limitations of its methods and the scope of its known
laws."

To ferret out the processes by which the heavenly bodies have been
brought to their present condition we seek first of all for lines of
development now in progress which tend to change the existing order of
things into something different, and, having found these, to trace their
effects into both past and future. Any force, however small, or any
process, however slow, may produce great results if it works always and
ceaselessly in the same direction, and it is in these processes, whose
trend is never reversed, that we find a partial clew to both past and
future.

228. THE SUN'S DEVELOPMENT.--The first of these to claim our attention
is the shrinking of the sun's diameter which, as we have seen in Chapter
X, is the means by which the solar output of radiant energy is
maintained from year to year. Its amount, only a few feet per annum, is
far too small to be measured with any telescope; but it is cumulative,
working century after century in the same direction, and, given time
enough, it will produce in the future, and must have produced in the
past, enormous transformations in the sun's bulk and equally significant
changes in its physical condition.

Thus, as we attempt to trace the sun's history into the past, the
farther back we go the greater shall we expect to find its diameter and
the greater the space (volume) through which its molecules are spread.
By reason of this expansion its density must have been less then than
now, and by going far enough back we may even reach a time at which the
density was comparable with what we find in the nebulæ of to-day. If our
ideas of the sun's present mechanism are sound, then, as a necessary
consequence of these, its past career must have been a process of
condensation in which its component particles were year by year packed
closer together by their own attraction for each other. As we have seen
in § 126, this condensation necessarily developed heat, a part of which
was radiated away as fast as produced, while the remainder was stored
up, and served to raise the temperature of the sun to what we find it
now. At the present time this temperature is a chief obstacle to further
shrinkage, and so powerfully opposes the gravitative forces as to
maintain nearly an equilibrium with them, thus causing a very slow rate
of further condensation. But it is not probable that this was always so.
In the early stages of the sun's history, when the temperature was low,
contraction of its bulk must have been more rapid, and attempts have
been made by the mathematicians to measure its rate of progress and to
determine how long a time has been consumed in the development of the
present sun from a primitive nebulous condition in which it filled a
space of greater diameter than Neptune's orbit. Of course, numerical
precision is not to be expected in results of this kind, but, from a
consideration of the greatest amount of heat that could be furnished by
the shrinkage of a mass equal to that of the sun, it seems that the
period of this development is to be measured in tens of millions or
possibly hundreds of millions of years, but almost certainly does not
reach a thousand millions.

229. THE SUN'S FUTURE.--The future duration of the sun as a source of
radiant energy is surely to be measured in far smaller numbers than
these. Its career as a dispenser of light and heat is much more than
half spent, for the shrinkage results in an ever-increasing density,
which makes its gaseous substance approximate more and more toward the
behavior of a liquid or solid, and we recall that these forms of matter
can not by any further condensation restore the heat whose loss through
radiation caused them to contract. They may continue to shrink, but
their temperature must fall, and when the sun's substance becomes too
dense to obey the laws of gaseous matter its surface must cool rapidly
as a consequence of the radiation into surrounding space, and must
congeal into a crust which, although at first incandescent, will
speedily become dark and opaque, cutting off the light of the central
portions, save as it may be rent from time to time by volcanic outbursts
of the still incandescent mass beneath. But such outbursts can be of
short duration only, and its final condition must be that of a dark
body, like the earth or moon, no longer available as a source of radiant
energy. Even before the formation of a solid crust it is quite possible
that the output of light and heat may be seriously diminished by the
formation of dense vapors completely enshrouding it, as is now the case
with Jupiter and Saturn. It is believed that these planets were formerly
incandescent, and at the present time are in a state of development
through which the earth has passed and toward which the sun is moving.
According to Newcomb, the future during which the sun can continue to
furnish light and heat at its present rate is not likely to exceed
10,000,000 years.

This idea of the sun as a developing body whose present state is only
temporary, furnishes a clew to some of the vexing problems of solar
physics. Thus the sun-spot period, the distribution of the spots in
latitude, and the peculiar law of rotation of the sun in different
latitudes, may be, and very probably are, results not of anything now
operating beneath its photosphere, but of something which happened to it
in the remote past--e. g., an unsymmetrical shrinkage or possibly a
collision with some other body. At sea the waves continue to toss long
after the storm which produced them has disappeared, and, according to
the mathematical researches of Wilsing, a profound agitation of the
sun's mass might well require tens of thousands, or even hundreds of
thousands of years to subside, and during this time its effects would be
visible, like the waves, as phenomena for which the actual condition of
things furnishes no apparent cause.

230. THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.--The theory of the sun's progressive
contraction as a necessary result of its radiation of energy is
comparatively modern, but more than a century ago philosophic students
of Nature had been led in quite a different way to the belief that in
the earlier stages of its career the sun must have been an enormously
extended body whose outer portions reached even beyond the orbit of the
remotest planet. Laplace, whose speculations upon this subject have had
a dominant influence during the nineteenth century, has left, in a
popular treatise upon astronomy, an admirable statement of the phenomena
of planetary motion, which suggest and lead up to the nebular theory of
the sun's development, and in presenting this theory we shall follow
substantially his line of thought, but with some freedom of translation
and many omissions.

He says: "To trace out the primitive source of the planetary movements,
we have the following five phenomena: (1) These movements all take place
in the same direction and nearly in the same plane. (2) The movements of
the satellites are in the same direction as those of the planets. (3)
The rotations of the planets and the sun are in the same direction as
the orbital motions and nearly in the same plane. (4) Planets and
satellites alike have nearly circular orbits. (5) The orbits of comets
are wholly unlike these by reason of their great eccentricities and
inclinations to the ecliptic." That these coincidences should be purely
the result of chance seemed to Laplace incredible, and, seeking a cause
for them, he continues: "Whatever its nature may be, since it has
produced or controlled the motions of the planets, it must have reached
out to all these bodies, and, in view of the prodigious distances which
separate them, the cause can have been nothing else than a fluid of
great extent which must have enveloped the sun like an atmosphere. A
consideration of the planetary motions leads us to think that ... the
sun's atmosphere formerly extended far beyond the orbits of all the
planets and has shrunk by degrees to its present dimensions." This is
not very different from the idea developed in § 228 from a consideration
of the sun's radiant energy; but in Laplace's day the possibility of
generating the sun's heat by contraction of its bulk was unknown, and he
was compelled to assume a very high temperature for the primitive
nebulous sun, while we now know that this is unnecessary. Whether the
primitive nebula was hot or cold the shrinkage would take place in much
the same way, and would finally result in a star or sun of very high
temperature, but its development would be slower if it were hot in the
beginning than if it were cold.

But again Laplace: "How did the sun's atmosphere determine the rotations
and revolutions of planets and satellites? If these bodies had been
deeply immersed in this atmosphere its resistance to their motion would
have made them fall into the sun, and we may therefore conjecture that
the planets were formed, one by one, at the outer limits of the solar
atmosphere by the condensation of zones of vapor which were cast off in
the plane of the sun's equator." Here he proceeds to show by an appeal
to dynamical principles that something of this kind must happen, and
that the matter sloughed off by the nebula in the form of a ring,
perhaps comparable to the rings of Saturn or the asteroid zone, would
ultimately condense into a planet, which in its turn might shrink and
cast off rings to produce satellites.

[Illustration: PIERRE SIMON LAPLACE (1749-1827).]

Planets and satellites would then all have similar motions, as noted at
the beginning of this section, since in every case this motion is an
inheritance from a common source, the rotation of the primitive
nebula about its own axis. "All the bodies which circle around a planet
having been thus formed from rings which its atmosphere successively
abandoned as rotation became more and more rapid, this rotation should
take place in less time than is required for the orbital revolution of
any of the bodies which have been cast off, and this holds true for the
sun as compared with the planets."

231. OBJECTIONS TO THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.--In Laplace's time this
slower rate of motion was also supposed to hold true for Saturn's rings
as compared with the rotation of Saturn itself, but, as we have seen in
Chapter XI, this ring is made up of a great number of independent
particles which move at different rates of speed, and comparing, through
Kepler's Third Law, the motion of the inner edge of the ring with the
known periodic time of the satellites, we may find that these particles
must rotate about Saturn more rapidly than the planet turns upon its
axis. Similarly the inner satellite of Mars completes its revolution in
about one third of a Martian day, and we find in cases like this grounds
for objection to the nebular theory. Compare also Laplace's argument
with the peculiar rotations of Uranus, Neptune, and their satellites
(Chapter XI). Do these fortify or weaken his case?

Despite these objections and others equally serious that have been
raised, the nebular theory agrees with the facts of Nature at so many
points that astronomers upon the whole are strongly inclined to accept
its major outlines as being at least an approximation to the course of
development actually followed by the solar system; but at some
points--e. g., the formation of planets and satellites through the
casting off of nebulous rings--the objections are so many and strong as
to call for revision and possibly serious modification of the theory.

One proposed modification, much discussed in recent years, consists in
substituting for the primitive _gaseous_ nebula imagined by Laplace, a
very diffuse cloud of meteoric matter which in the course of its
development would become transformed into the gaseous state by rising
temperature. From this point of view much of the meteoric dust still
scattered throughout the solar system may be only the fragments left
over in fashioning the sun and planets. Chamberlin and Moulton, who have
recently given much attention to this subject, in dissenting from some
of Laplace's views, consider that the primitive nebulous condition must
have been one in which the matter of the system was "so brought together
as to give low mass, high momentum, and irregular distribution to the
outer part, and high mass, low momentum, and sphericity to the central
part," and they suggest a possible oblique collision of a small nebula
with the outer parts of a large one.

232. BODE'S LAW.--We should not leave the theory of Laplace without
noting the light it casts upon one point otherwise obscure--the meaning
of Bode's law (§ 134). This law, stated in mathematical form, makes a
geometrical series, and similar geometrical series apply to the
distances of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn from these planets.
Now, Roche has shown by the application of physical laws to the
shrinkage of a gaseous body that its radius at any time may be expressed
by means of a certain mathematical formula very similar to Bode's law,
save that it involves the amount of time that has elapsed since the
beginning of the shrinking process. By comparing this formula with the
one corresponding to Bode's law he reaches the conclusion that the
peculiar spacing of the planets expressed by that law means that they
were formed at successive _equal_ intervals of time--i. e., that Mars is
as much older than the earth as the earth is older than Venus, etc. The
failure of Bode's law in the case of Neptune would then imply that the
interval of time between the formation of Neptune and Uranus was shorter
than that which has prevailed for the other planets. But too much
stress should not be placed upon this conclusion. So long as the manner
in which the planets came into being continues an open question,
conclusions about their time of birth must remain of doubtful validity.

233. TIDAL FRICTION BETWEEN EARTH AND MOON.--An important addition to
theories of development within the solar system has been worked out by
Prof. G. H. Darwin, who, starting with certain very simple assumptions
as to the present condition of things in earth and moon, derives from
these, by a strict process of mathematical reasoning, far-reaching
conclusions of great interest and importance. The key to these
conclusions lies in recognition of the fact that through the influence
of the tides (§ 42) there is now in progress and has been in progress
for a very long time, a gradual transfer of motion (moment of momentum)
from the earth to the moon. The earth's motion of rotation is being
slowly destroyed by the friction of the tides, as the motion of a
bicycle is destroyed by the friction of a brake, and, in consequence of
this slowing down, the moon is pushed farther and farther away from the
earth, so that it now moves in a larger orbit than it had some millions
of years ago.

Fig. 24 has been used to illustrate the action of the moon in raising
tides upon the earth, but in accordance with the third law of motion
(§ 36) this action must be accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction
whose nature may readily be seen from the same figure. The moon moves
about its orbit from west to east and the earth rotates about its axis
in the same direction, as shown by the curved arrow in the figure. The
tidal wave, _I_, therefore points a little _in advance_ of the moon's
position in its orbit and by its attraction must tend to pull the moon
ahead in its orbital motion a little faster than it would move if the
whole substance of the earth were placed inside the sphere represented
by the broken circle in the figure. It is true that the tidal wave at
_I´´_ pulls back and tends to neutralize the effect of the wave at _I_,
but on the whole the tidal wave nearer the moon has the stronger
influence, and the moon on the whole moves a very little faster, and by
virtue of this added impetus draws continually a little farther away
from the earth than it would if there were no tides.

234. CONSEQUENCES OF TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE EARTH.--This process of
moving the moon away from the earth is a cumulative one, going on
century after century, and with reference to it the moon's orbit must be
described not as a circle or ellipse, or any other curve which returns
into itself, but as a spiral, like the balance spring of a watch, each
of whose coils is a little larger than the preceding one, although this
excess is, to be sure, very small, because the tides themselves are
small and the tidal influence feeble when compared with the whole
attraction of the earth for the moon. But, given time enough, even this
small force may accomplish great results, and something like 100,000,000
years of past opportunity would have sufficed for the tidal forces to
move the moon from close proximity with the earth out to its present
position.

For millions of years to come, if moon and earth endure so long, the
distance between them must go on increasing, although at an ever slower
rate, since the farther away the moon goes the smaller will be the tides
and the slower the working out of their results. On the other hand, when
the moon was nearer the earth than now, tidal influences must have been
greater and their effects more rapidly produced than at the present
time, particularly if, as seems probable, at some past epoch the earth
was hot and plastic like Jupiter and Saturn. Then, instead of tides in
the water of the sea, such as we now have, the whole substance of the
earth would respond to the moon's attraction in _bodily tides_ of
semi-fluid matter not only higher, but with greater internal friction of
their molecules one upon another, and correspondingly greater effect in
checking the earth's rotation.

But, whether the tide be a bodily one or confined to the waters of the
sea, so long as the moon causes it to flow there will be a certain
amount of friction which will affect the earth much as a brake affects a
revolving wheel, slowing down its motion, and producing thus a longer
day as well as a longer month on account of the moon's increased
distance. Slowing down the earth's rotation is the direct action of the
moon upon the earth. Pushing the moon away is the form in which the
earth's equal and contrary reaction manifests itself.

235. CONSEQUENCES OF TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE MOON.--When the moon was
plastic the earth must have raised in it a bodily tide manifold greater
than the lunar tides upon the earth, and, as we have seen in Chapter IX,
this tide has long since worn out the greater part of the moon's
rotation and brought our satellite to the condition in which it presents
always the same face toward the earth.

These two processes, slowing down the rotation and pushing away the
disturbing body, are inseparable--one requires the other; and it is
worth noting in this connection that when for any reason the tide ceases
to flow, and the tidal wave takes up a permanent position, as it has in
the moon (§ 99), its work is ended, for when there is no motion of the
wave there can be no friction to further reduce the rate of rotation of
the one body, and no reaction to that friction to push away the other.
But this permanent and stationary tidal wave in the moon, or elsewhere,
means that the satellite presents always the same face toward its
planet, moving once about its orbit in the time required for one
revolution upon its axis, and the tide raised by the moon upon the earth
tends to produce here the result long since achieved in our satellite,
to make our day and month of equal length, and to make the earth turn
always the same side toward the moon. But the moon's tidal force is
small compared with that of the earth, and has a vastly greater momentum
to overcome, so that its work upon the earth is not yet complete.
According to Thomson and Tait, the moon must be pushed off another
hundred thousand miles, and the day lengthened out by tidal influence to
seven of our present weeks before the day and the lunar month are made
of equal length, and the moon thereby permanently hidden from one
hemisphere of the earth.

236. THE EARTH-MOON SYSTEM.--Retracing into the past the course of
development of the earth and moon, it is possible to reach back by means
of the mathematical theory of tidal friction to a time at which these
bodies were much nearer to each other than now, but it has not been
found possible to trace out the mode of their separation from one body
into two, as is supposed in the nebular theory. In the earliest part of
their history accessible to mathematical analysis they are distinct
bodies at some considerable distance from each other, with the earth
rotating about an axis more nearly perpendicular to the moon's orbit and
to the ecliptic than is now the case. Starting from such a condition,
the lunar tides, according to Darwin, have been instrumental in tipping
the earth's rotation axis into its present oblique position, and in
determining the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and its position with
respect to the ecliptic as well as the present length of day and month.

337. TIDAL FRICTION UPON THE PLANETS.--The satellites of the outer
planets are equally subject to influences of this kind, and there
appears to be independent evidence that some of them, at least, turn
always the same face toward their respective planets, indicating that
the work of tidal friction has here been accomplished. We saw in Chapter
XI that it is at present an open question whether the inner planets,
Venus and Mercury, do not always turn the same face toward the sun,
their day and year being of equal length. In addition to the direct
observational evidence upon this point, Schiaparelli has sought to show
by an appeal to tidal theory that such is probably the case, at least
for Mercury, since the tidal forces which tend to bring about this
result in that planet are about as great as the forces which have
certainly produced it in the case of the moon and Saturn's satellite,
Japetus. The same line of reasoning would show that every satellite in
the solar system, save possibly the newly discovered ninth satellite of
Saturn, must, as a consequence of tidal friction, turn always the same
face toward its planet.

238. THE SOLAR TIDE.--The sun also raises tides in the earth, and their
influence must be similar in character to that of the lunar tides,
checking the rotation of the earth and thrusting earth and sun apart,
although quantitatively these effects are small compared with those of
the moon. They must, however, continue so long as the solar tide lasts,
possibly until the day and year are made of equal length--i. e., they
may continue long after the lunar tidal influence has ceased to push
earth and moon apart. Should this be the case, a curious inverse effect
will be produced. The day being then longer than the month, the moon
will again raise a tide in the earth which will run around it _from west
to east_, opposite to the course of the present tide, thus tending to
accelerate the earth's rotation, and by its reaction to bring the moon
back toward the earth again, and ultimately to fall upon it.

We may note that an effect of this kind must be in progress now between
Mars and its inner satellite, Phobos, whose time of orbital revolution
is only one third of a Martian day. It seems probable that this
satellite is in the last stages of its existence as an independent body,
and must ultimately fall into Mars.

239. ROCHE'S LIMIT.--In looking forward to such a catastrophe, however,
due regard must be paid to a dynamical principle of a different
character. The moon can never be precipitated upon the earth entire,
since before it reaches us it will have been torn asunder by the excess
of the earth's attraction for the near side of its satellite over that
which it exerts upon the far side. As the result of Roche's mathematical
analysis we are able to assign a limiting distance between any planet
and its satellite within which the satellite, if it turns always the
same face toward the planet, can not come without being broken into
fragments. If we represent the radius of the planet by _r_, and the
quotient obtained by dividing the density of the planet by the density
of the satellite by _q_, then

    Roche's limit = 2.44 r ∛q.

Thus in the case of earth and moon we find from the densities given in
§ 95, _q_ = 1.65, and with _r_ = 3,963 miles we obtain 11,400 miles as
the nearest approach which the moon could make to the earth without
being broken up by the difference of the earth's attractions for its
opposite sides.

We must observe, however, that Roche's limit takes no account of
molecular forces, the adhesion of one molecule to another, by virtue of
which a stick or stone resists fracture, but is concerned only with the
gravitative forces by which the molecules are attracted toward the
moon's center and toward the earth. Within a stone or rock of moderate
size these gravitative forces are insignificant, and cohesion is the
chief factor in preserving its integrity, but in a large body like the
moon, the case is just reversed, cohesion plays a small part and
gravitation a large one in holding the body together. We may conclude,
therefore, that at a proper distance these forces are capable of
breaking up the moon, or any other large body, into fragments of a size
such that molecular cohesion instead of gravitation is the chief agent
in preserving them from further disintegration.

240. SATURN'S RINGS.--Saturn's rings are of peculiar interest in this
connection. The outer edge of the ring system lies just inside of
Roche's limit for this planet, and we have already seen that the rings
are composed of small fragments independent of each other. Whatever may
have been the process by which the nine satellites of Saturn came into
existence, we have in Roche's limit the explanation why the material of
the ring was not worked up into satellites; the forces exerted by Saturn
would tear into pieces any considerable satellite thus formed and
equally would prevent the formation of one from raw material.

Saturn's rings present the only case within the solar system where
matter is known to be revolving about a planet at a distance less than
Roche's limit, and it is an interesting question whether these rings can
remain as a permanent part of the planet's system or are only a
temporary feature. The drawings of Saturn made two centuries ago agree
among themselves in representing the rings as larger than they now
appear, and there is some reason to suppose that as a consequence of
mutual disturbances--collisions--their momentum is being slowly wasted
so that ultimately they must be precipitated into the planet. But the
direct evidence of such a progress that can be drawn from present data
is too scanty to justify positive conclusions in the matter. On the
other hand, Nolan suggests that in the outer parts of the ring small
satellites might be formed whose tidal influence upon Saturn would
suffice to push them away from the ring beyond Roche's limit, and that
the very small inner satellites of Saturn may have been thus formed at
the expense of the ring.

The inner satellite of Mars is very close to Roche's limit for that
planet, and, as we have seen above, must be approaching still nearer to
the danger line.

241. THE MOON'S DEVELOPMENT.--The fine series of photographs of the moon
obtained within the last few years at Paris, have been used by the
astronomers of that observatory for a minute study of the lunar
formations, much as geologists study the surface of the earth to
determine something about the manner in which it was formed. Their
conclusions are, in general, that at some past time the moon was a hot
and fluid body which, as it cooled and condensed, formed a solid crust
whose further shrinkage compressed the liquid nucleus and led to a long
series of fractures in the crust and outbursts of liquid matter, whose
latest and feeblest stages produced the lunar craters, while traces of
the earlier ones, connected with a general settling of the crust,
although nearly obliterated, are still preserved in certain large but
vague features of the lunar topography, such as the distribution of the
seas, etc. They find also in certain markings of the surface what they
consider convincing evidence of the existence in past times of a lunar
atmosphere. But this seems doubtful, since the force of gravity at the
moon's surface is so small that an atmosphere similar to that of the
earth, even though placed upon the moon, could not permanently endure,
but would be lost by the gradual escape of its molecules into the
surrounding space.

The molecules of a gas are quite independent one of another, and are in
a state of ceaseless agitation, each one darting to and fro, colliding
with its neighbors or with whatever else opposes its forward motion, and
traveling with velocities which, on the average, amount to a good many
hundreds of feet per second, although in the case of any individual
molecule they may be much less or much greater than the average value,
an occasional molecule having possibly a velocity several times as great
as the average. In the upper regions of our own atmosphere, if one of
these swiftly moving particles of oxygen or nitrogen were headed away
from the earth with a velocity of seven miles per second, the whole
attractive power of the earth would be insufficient to check its motion,
and it would therefore, unless stopped by some collision, escape from
the earth and return no more. But, since this velocity of seven miles
per second is more than thirty times as great as the average velocity of
the molecules of air, it must be very seldom indeed that one is found to
move so swiftly, and the loss of the earth's atmosphere by leakage of
this sort is insignificant. But upon the moon, or any other body where
the force of gravity is small, conditions are quite different, and in
our satellite a velocity of little more than one mile per second would
suffice to carry a molecule away from the outer limits of its
atmosphere. This velocity, only five times the average, would be
frequently attained, particularly in former times when the moon's
temperature was high, for then the average velocity of all the molecules
would be considerably increased, and the amount of leakage might become,
and probably would become, a serious matter, steadily depleting the
moon's atmosphere and leading finally to its present state of
exhaustion. It is possible that the moon may at one time have had an
atmosphere, but if so it could have been only a temporary possession,
and the same line of reasoning may be applied to the asteroids and to
most of the satellites of the solar system, and also, though in less
degree, to the smaller planets, Mercury and Mars.

242. STELLAR DEVELOPMENT.--We have already considered in this chapter
the line of development followed by one star, the sun, and treating this
as a typical case, it is commonly believed that the life history of a
star, in so far as it lies within our reach, begins with a condition in
which its matter is widely diffused, and presumably at a low
temperature. Contracting in bulk under the influence of its own
gravitative forces, the star's temperature rises to a maximum, and then
falls off in later stages until the body ceases to shine and passes over
to the list of dark stars whose existence can only be detected in
exceptional cases, such as are noted in Chapter XIII. The most
systematic development of this idea is due to Lockyer, who looks upon
all the celestial bodies--sun, moon and planets, stars, nebulæ, and
comets--as being only collections of meteoric matter in different stages
of development, and who has sought by means of their spectra to classify
these bodies and to determine their stage of advancement. While the
fundamental ideas involved in this "meteoritic hypothesis" are not
seriously controverted, the detailed application of its principles is
open to more question, and for the most part those astronomers who hold
that in the present state of knowledge stellar spectra furnish a key to
a star's age or degree of advancement do not venture beyond broad
general statements.

[Illustration: FIG. 151.--Types of stellar spectra substantially
according to SECCHI.]

243. STELLAR SPECTRA.--Thus the types of stellar spectra shown in Fig.
151 are supposed to illustrate successive stages in the development of
an average star. Type I corresponds to the period in which its
temperature is near the maximum; Type II belongs to a later stage in
which the temperature has commenced to fall; and Type III to the period
immediately preceding extinction.

While human life, or even the duration of the human race, is too short
to permit a single star to be followed through all the stages of its
career, an adequate picture of that development might be obtained by
examining many stars, each at a different stage of progress, and,
following this idea, numerous subdivisions of the types of stellar
spectra shown in Fig. 151 have been proposed in order to represent with
more detail the process of stellar growth and decay; but for the most
part these subdivisions and their interpretation are accepted by
astronomers with much reserve.

It is significant that there are comparatively few stars with spectra of
Type III, for this is what we should expect to find if the development
of a star through the last stages of its visible career occupied but a
small fraction of its total life. From the same point of view the great
number of stars with spectra of the first type would point to a long
duration of this stage of life. The period in which the sun belongs,
represented by Type II, probably has a duration intermediate between the
others. Since most of the variable stars, save those of the Algol class,
have spectra of the third type, we conclude that variability, with its
associated ruddy color and great atmospheric absorption of light, is a
sign of old age and approaching extinction. The Algol or eclipse
variables, on the other hand, having spectra of the first type, are
comparatively young stars, and, as we shall see a little later, the
shortness of their light periods in some measure confirms this
conclusion drawn from their spectra.

We have noted in § 196 that the sun's near neighbors are prevailingly
stars with spectra of the second type, while the Milky Way is mainly
composed of first-type stars, and from this we may now conclude that in
our particular part of the entire celestial space the stars are, as a
rule, somewhat further developed than is the case elsewhere.

244. DOUBLE STARS.--The double stars present special problems of
development growing out of the effects of tidal friction, which must
operate in them much as it does between earth and moon, tending steadily
to increase the distance between the components of such a star. So, too,
in such a system as is shown in Fig. 132, gravity must tend to make each
component of the double star shrink to smaller dimensions, and this
shrinkage must result in faster rotation and increased tidal friction,
which in turn must push the components apart, so that in view of the
small density and close proximity of those particular stars we may
fairly regard a star like β Lyræ as in the early stages of its
career and destined with increasing age to lose its variability of
light, since the eclipses which now take place must cease with
increasing distance between the components unless the orbit is turned
exactly edgewise toward the earth. Close proximity and the resulting
shortness of periodic time in a double star seem, therefore, to be
evidence of its youth, and since this shortness of periodic time is
characteristic of both Algol variables and spectroscopic binaries as a
class, we may set them down as being, upon the whole, stars in the early
stages of their career. On the other hand, it is generally true that the
larger the orbit, and the greater the periodic time in the orbit, the
farther is the star advanced in its development.

In his theory of tidal friction, Darwin has pointed out that whenever
the periodic time in the orbit is more than twice as long as the time
required for rotation about the axis, the effect of the tides is to
increase the eccentricity of the orbit, and, following this indication,
See has urged that with increasing distance between the components of a
double star their orbits about the common center of gravity must grow
more and more eccentric, so that we have in the shape of such orbits a
new index of stellar development; the more eccentric the orbit, the
farther advanced are the stars. It is important to note in this
connection that among the double stars whose orbits have been computed
there seems to run a general rule--the larger the orbit the greater is
its eccentricity--a relation which must hold true if tidal friction
operates as above supposed, and which, being found to hold true,
confirms in some degree the criteria of stellar age which are furnished
by the theory of tidal friction.

245. NEBULÆ.--The nebular hypothesis of Laplace has inclined astronomers
to look upon nebulæ in general as material destined to be worked up into
stars, but which is now in a very crude and undeveloped stage. Their
great bulk and small density seem also to indicate that gravitation has
not yet produced in them results at all comparable with what we see in
sun and stars. But even among nebulæ there are to be found very
different stages of development. The irregular nebula, shapeless and
void like that of Orion; the spiral, ring, and planetary nebulæ and the
star cluster, clearly differ in amount of progress toward their final
goal. But it is by no means sure that these several types are different
stages in one line of development; for example, the primitive nebula
which grows into a spiral may never become a ring or planetary nebula,
and _vice versa_. So too there is no reason to suppose that a star
cluster will ever break up into isolated stars such as those whose
relation to each other is shown in Fig. 122.

246. CLASSIFICATION.--Considering the heavenly bodies with respect to
their stage of development, and arranging them in due order, we should
probably find lowest down in the scale of progress the irregular nebulæ
of chaotic appearance such as that represented in Fig. 146. Above these
in point of development stand the spiral, ring, and planetary nebulæ,
although the exact sequence in which they should be arranged remains a
matter of doubt. Still higher up in the scale are star clusters whose
individual members, as well as isolated stars, are to be classified by
means of their spectra, as shown in Fig. 151, where the order of
development of each star is probably from Type I, through II, into III
and beyond, to extinction of its light and the cutting off of most of
its radiant energy. Jupiter and Saturn are to be regarded as stars which
have recently entered this dark stage. The earth is further developed
than these, but it is not so far along as are Mars and Mercury; while
the moon is to be looked upon as the most advanced heavenly body
accessible to our research, having reached a state of decrepitude which
may almost be called death--a stage typical of that toward which all the
others are moving.

Meteors and comets are to be regarded as fragments of celestial matter,
chips, too small to achieve by themselves much progress along the normal
lines of development, but destined sooner or later, by collision with
some larger body, to share thenceforth in its fortunes.

247. STABILITY OF THE UNIVERSE.--It was considered a great achievement
in the mathematical astronomy of a century ago when Laplace showed that
the mutual attractions of sun and planets might indeed produce endless
perturbations in the motions and positions of these bodies, but could
never bring about collisions among them or greatly alter their existing
orbits. But in the proof of this great theorem two influences were
neglected, either of which is fatal to its validity. One of these--tidal
friction--as we have already seen, tends to wreck the systems of
satellites, and the same effect must be produced upon the planets by any
other influence which tends to impede their orbital motion. It is the
inertia of the planet in its forward movement that balances the sun's
attraction, and any diminution of the planet's velocity will give this
attraction the upper hand and must ultimately precipitate the planet
into the sun. The meteoric matter with which the earth comes ceaselessly
into collision must have just this influence, although its effects are
very small, and something of the same kind may come from the medium
which transmits radiant energy through the interstellar spaces.

It seems incredible that the luminiferous ether, which is supposed to
pervade all space, should present absolutely no resistance to the motion
of stars and planets rushing through it with velocities which in many
cases exceed 50,000 miles per hour. If there is a resistance to this
motion, however small, we may extend to the whole visible universe the
words of Thomson and Tait, who say in their great Treatise on Natural
Philosophy, "We have no data in the present state of science for
estimating the relative importance of tidal friction and of the
resistance of the resisting medium through which the earth and moon
move; but, whatever it may be, there can be but one ultimate result for
such a system as that of the sun and planets, if continuing long enough
under existing laws and not disturbed by meeting with other moving
masses in space. That result is the falling together of all into one
mass, which, although rotating for a time, must in the end come to rest
relatively to the surrounding medium."

Compare with this the words of a great poet who in The Tempest puts into
the mouth of Prospero the lines:

    "The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;
    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
    Leave not a rack behind."

248. THE FUTURE.--In spite of statements like these, it lies beyond the
scope of scientific research to affirm that the visible order of things
will ever come to naught, and the outcome of present tendencies, as
sketched above, may be profoundly modified in ages to come, by
influences of which we are now ignorant. We have already noted that the
farther our speculation extends into either past or future, the more
insecure are its conclusions, and the remoter consequences of present
laws are to be accepted with a corresponding reserve. But the one great
fact which stands out clear in this connection is that of _change_. The
old concept of a universe created in finished form and destined so to
abide until its final dissolution, has passed away from scientific
thought and is replaced by the idea of slow development. A universe
which is ever becoming something else and is never finished, as shadowed
forth by Goethe in the lines:

    "Thus work I at the roaring loom of Time,
    And weave for Deity a living robe sublime."
